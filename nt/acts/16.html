Then</span> came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/16/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Acts 17: 14 (14-15); Acts 20: 4; 1 Cor. 4: 17; 1 Thes. 1: 1; 1 Thes. 3: 2 (2, 6); 1 Tim. 1: 2.">Timotheus</a>, the son of a certain woman, which was a <sup>b</sup><a href="acts/16/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Tim. 1: 5.">Jewess</a>, and believed; but his father <i>was</i> a Greek:

&#182; And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/16/16a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Sorcery.">soothsaying</a>:
