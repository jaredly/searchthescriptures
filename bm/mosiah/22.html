And</span> now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/22/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 18.">deliver</a> themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.

And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.

And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.

Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city.  The Lamanites, or the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/22/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 28; Mosiah 21: 5.">guards</a> of the Lamanites, by night are <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/22/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 55: 14 (8-17).">drunken</a>; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.
