Many members of the Church are led into sin by unbelievers—Alma is promised eternal life—Those who repent and are baptized gain forgiveness—Church members in sin who repent and confess to Alma and to the Lord shall be forgiven; otherwise they shall be excommunicated.

Now</span> it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/26/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 2: 1.">words</a> of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/26/1b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Family, Children, Duties of.">not</a> believe the tradition of their fathers.

They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.

And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/26/5a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Apostasy.">dissensions</a> among the brethren they became more numerous.
