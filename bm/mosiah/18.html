And</span> now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/18/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 9.">repented</a> of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi—

And it came to pass *after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma.

And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.
