Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites, from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites.  But behold, I of myself <sup>a</sup><a href="omni/1/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Confession; TG Honesty; TG Humility.">am</a> a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.

And it came to pass that *two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many <sup>a</sup><a href="omni/1/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 13.">seasons</a> of serious war and bloodshed.  Yea, and in fine, *two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept these plates according to the <sup>b</sup><a href="omni/1/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Jacob 1: 1 (1-4); Jacob 7: 27; Jarom 1: 15 (1-2, 15).">commandments</a> of my <sup>c</sup><a href="omni/1/3c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Patriarch.">fathers</a>; and I <sup>d</sup><a href="omni/1/3d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Delegation of Responsibility.">conferred</a> them upon my son Amaron.

For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling into the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words should not be verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: <sup>a</sup><a href="omni/1/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 9; Mosiah 1: 7.">Inasmuch</a> as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall not <sup>b</sup><a href="omni/1/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Deut. 28: 29.">prosper</a> in the land.

And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him.  And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings.  And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his <sup>a</sup><a href="omni/1/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Isa. 33: 2; Mosiah 12: 24.">arm</a>, through the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the <sup>b</sup><a href="omni/1/13b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 1: 1; Mosiah 2: 4.">land</a> of Zarahemla.

And they discovered a <sup>a</sup><a href="omni/1/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 1: 10.">people</a>, who were called the people of Zarahemla.  Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the <sup>b</sup><a href="omni/1/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 3: 3 (3, 19-20); 1 Ne. 5: 10 (10-22).">plates</a> of brass which contained the record of the Jews.

And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become exceedingly numerous.

And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but <sup>b</sup><a href="omni/1/18b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 9: 4; W of M 1: 10.">not</a> in these plates.
