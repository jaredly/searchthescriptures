Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the <sup>a</sup><a href="jarom/1/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Enos 1: 22 (22-23).">stiffness</a> of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet <sup>b</sup><a href="jarom/1/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ether 2: 8 (8-10).">swept</a> them off from the face of the land.

And now, behold, *two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land.

And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us.
