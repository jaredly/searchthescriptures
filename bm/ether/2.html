And</span> it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 1: 36.">friends</a> of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the name of the valley was <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 10: 8; 1 Chr. 1: 10.">Nimrod</a>, being called after the mighty hunter) with their <sup>c</sup><a href="ether/2/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ether 1: 41; Ether 6: 4; Ether 9: 18 (18-19).">flocks</a> which they had gathered together, male and female, of every kind.

And they did also lay snares and catch <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 7: 3 (1-3).">fowls</a> of the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them the fish of the waters.

And it came to pass that when they had come down into the valley of Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Num. 11: 25; D&C 34: 7 (7-9); JS-H 1: 68 (68-71).">cloud</a>, and the brother of Jared saw him not.

And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Promised Lands.">land</a> of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 4: 14.">preserved</a> for a righteous people.

And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 13: 2.">serve</a> him, the true and only God, or they should be <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 3 (3, 10); Alma 37: 28; Ether 9: 20.">swept</a> off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them.

And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands.  And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 7; Ether 1: 34.">Moriancumer</a>; and they dwelt in <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/13b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 25: 27; Hel. 3: 9.">tents</a>, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years.

And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/14b" mark="b" type="C" title="1 Ne. 16: 25; TG Chastening; TG Reproof.">chastened</a> him because he remembered not to <sup>c</sup><a href="ether/2/14c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Prayer.">call</a> upon the name of the Lord.

And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him.  And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/15a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG God, Spirit of.">Spirit</a> will not always <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 6: 3; 2 Ne. 26: 11; Morm. 5: 16; Moses 8: 17.">strive</a> with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/2/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 2: 6.">barges</a> which ye have hitherto built.  And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/2/16b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ex. 25: 40; Prov. 16: 9; 1 Ne. 17: 51 (50-51).">instructions</a> of the Lord.
