And</span> now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 1: 34.">Jared</a> and his brother.

For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 3: 3.">stones</a> which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.

And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give light unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great waters in darkness.

And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Food.">food</a>, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/6/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ether 2: 1; Ether 9: 18 (18-19).">whatsoever</a> beast or animal or fowl that they should carry with them—and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.

And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 2: 24 (24-25).">furious</a> wind blow upon the face of the waters, <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/6/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 18: 9.">towards</a> the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.

And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind.

And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 2: 17.">tight</a> like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/6/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 6: 14; Moses 7: 43.">ark</a> of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.

And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 18: 13 (8-13).">driven</a> forth before the wind.

And they did <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Singing.">sing</a> praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/6/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Chr. 16: 8 (7-36); Ps. 34: 1 (1-3); Alma 37: 37; D&C 46: 32.">thank</a> and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.

And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea could break them, neither <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 1: 21; Ether 2: 24.">whale</a> that could mar them; and they did have light continually, whether it was above the water or under the water.

And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his <sup>c</sup><a href="ether/6/12c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ether 7: 27; Ether 10: 2.">tender</a> mercies over them.

And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather together our people that we may number them, that we may know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves.

And accordingly the people were gathered together.  Now the number of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.

And now behold, this was grievous unto them.  And the brother of Jared said unto them: Surely this thing <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/23a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 8: 11 (10-18); Mosiah 29: 18 (16-23); Ether 7: 5.">leadeth</a> into captivity.

But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a king.  And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom ye will.

And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag.  And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/6/25a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Kings, Earthly.">king</a>.  And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.
