And</span> now it came to pass in the *forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.

And it came to pass in the *forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/3/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 63: 4.">northward</a> to inherit the land.

And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch that they came to <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/3/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 8; Alma 50: 29; Morm. 6: 4.">large</a> bodies of water and many rivers.

Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the land.

And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/3/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 8; Mosiah 21: 26 (26-27).">destruction</a> of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/3/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 22: 31.">desolate</a>.

And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/3/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Skill.">expert</a> in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.

And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/3/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 22: 27 (27, 32-33); Hel. 11: 20.">west</a> to the sea east.
