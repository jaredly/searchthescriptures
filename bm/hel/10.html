And it came to pass as he was thus pondering—being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites, their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of iniquities—and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/10/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Guidance, Divine.">voice</a> came unto him saying:
