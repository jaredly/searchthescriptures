Behold,</span> now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 9: 7 (7, 12).">five</a> who went, and they said among themselves, as they went:

Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us.  Behold, we do not <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 2: 9.">believe</a> that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.

And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 8: 27.">lie</a> in his blood.

And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge.

But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 22: 13 (8-20).">should</a> come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.

Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered—he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them;

And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the place of the judgment-seat—and behold, to their astonishment they saw those <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 9: 1.">five</a> men who had fallen to the earth.

And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 7: 10 (10-11, 14).">garden</a> of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.

And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison.  And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.

And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Mourning.">mourn</a> and to <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/9/10b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Fasting.">fast</a>, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.

And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.

<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>
<div id="hel/9/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead?  And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.

<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="hel/9/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:

<div id="hel/9/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 39: 20.">prison</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="hel/9/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 8: 27.">according</a> as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.

<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="hel/9/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="hel/9/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.

<div id="hel/9/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial.  Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.

<div id="hel/9/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death—

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="hel/9/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that hath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/20a" mark="a" type="C" title="1 Sam. 8: 3 (1-4); Ether 9: 11; TG Bribery.">money</a>; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made with him.

But Nephi said unto them: O ye <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/9/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ps. 75: 4; Luke 24: 25; Acts 7: 51.">fools</a>, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye blind, and ye <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/9/21b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Stiffneckedness.">stiffnecked</a> people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this your way of sin?
