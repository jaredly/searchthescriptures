<div class="summary">
Corrupt judges seek to incite the people against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, Zenos, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi all testified of Christ—By inspiration Nephi announces the murder of the chief judge.  Between 23 and 20 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?

For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.

And those judges were angry with him because he <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 16: 2 (2-3).">spake</a> plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.

Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 7: 22.">great</a> cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.

And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Moses 8: 21 (20-22).">powerful</a>, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.

And it came to pass that thus they did <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Provoking.">stir</a> up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/8/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Acts 5: 38 (37-40).">Let</a> this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;

Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities.

And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.

Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 14: 16; Josh. 2: 10; Neh. 9: 11; 1 Ne. 17: 26; Mosiah 7: 19; D&C 8: 3; Moses 1: 25.">Sea</a>, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?

And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/8/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 7: 29 (28-29).">know</a> concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?
