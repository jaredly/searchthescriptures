And about the time that <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/1/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="4 Ne. 1: 48 (47-49).">Ammaron</a> hid up the records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I began to be <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/1/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Enos 1: 1; Mosiah 1: 3 (3-5).">learned</a> somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a <sup>c</sup><a href="morm/1/2c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Sobriety, Sober, Soberness; TG Trustworthiness.">sober</a> child, and art quick to observe;

Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/1/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 2: 17.">land</a> Antum, unto a hill which shall be called <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/1/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Morm. 4: 23; Ether 9: 3.">Shim</a>; and there have I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people.

And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/1/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="4 Ne. 1: 36.">Nephites</a>, who consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was between the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.
