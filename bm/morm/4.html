And</span> now it came to pass that in the *three hundred and sixty and third year the Nephites did go up with their armies to <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 1: 12; Morm. 1: 11 (11-19).">battle</a> against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.

And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of Desolation.  And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 3: 23; Morm. 3: 7.">city</a> Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.

And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum.  Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it was also near the city <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 3: 5.">Desolation</a>.

And it was <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 3: 10 (10-11).">because</a> the armies of the Nephites went up unto the Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.

But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Nahum 1: 3.">wicked</a>; and it is by the wicked that the wicked are <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/4/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Pet. 2: 12; D&C 63: 33.">punished</a>; for it is the wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.

And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the Nephites.  And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did again <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 3: 9.">boast</a> of their own strength; and they went forth in their own might, and took possession again of the city Desolation.

And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/4/11a" mark="a" type="C" title="Moro. 9: 5 (5, 23); TG Blood, Shedding of.">delighted</a> in the shedding of blood continually.
