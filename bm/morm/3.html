And</span> it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again *until ten years more had passed away.  And behold, I had employed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against the time of battle.

And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this people—Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/3/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 15: 17 (16-17); Morm. 6: 11 (11-15).">spared</a>.

And I did cry unto this people, but it was <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/3/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 4: 18.">in</a> vain; and they did <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/3/3b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Hardheartedness; TG Ingratitude.">not</a> realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for repentance.

And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us.

And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might not get possession of any of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all our force.
