And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we might gather together our people unto the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/6/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 9: 3.">land</a> of <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/6/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Morm. 8: 2; D&C 128: 20.">Cumorah</a>, by a hill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give them battle.

And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/6/6a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Sacred.">sacred</a>, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/6/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Ne. 26: 17; Enos 1: 14.">destroy</a> them) therefore I made <sup>c</sup><a href="morm/6/6c" mark="c" type="A" title="Morm. 2: 18.">this</a> record out of the plates of Nephi, and <sup>d</sup><a href="morm/6/6d" mark="d" type="A" title="Ether 15: 11.">hid</a> up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were <sup>e</sup><a href="morm/6/6e" mark="e" type="A" title="Moro. 9: 24; Moro. 10: 2; D&C 17: 1; JS-H 1: 52.">these</a> few plates which I gave unto my son <sup>f</sup><a href="morm/6/6f" mark="f" type="A" title="Morm. 8: 1.">Moroni</a>.
