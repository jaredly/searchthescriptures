And</span> it came to pass that thus passed away the *ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 14: 6.">signs</a> and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—

And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Job 1: 7; D&C 10: 27.">go</a> about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.

Now the Nephites began to <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 5: 7; 3 Ne. 8: 2.">reckon</a> their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.

And it came to pass that the people did still <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 34: 35.">remain</a> in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.

And it came to pass in the *thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 1: 27.">Gadianton</a> robbers had become so <sup>b</sup><a href="3_ne/2/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="Morm. 2: 8.">numerous</a>, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.

Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/2/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 58: 12; 3 Ne. 3: 2.">safety</a> of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their <sup>b</sup><a href="3_ne/2/12b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Liberty.">liberty</a>.

And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.
