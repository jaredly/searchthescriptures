And</span> now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own lands in the *twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/6/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 3: 22 (21-23).">horses</a> and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.

And it came to pass that they had <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/6/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 4: 4.">not</a> eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both on the north and on the south, both on the land northward and on the land southward.

And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/6/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Order.">order</a> in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.

But it came to pass in the *twenty and ninth year there began to be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up unto pride and <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/6/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Boasting.">boastings</a> because of their exceedingly great riches, yea, even unto great persecutions;

And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the *thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/6/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 23: 6; Alma 27: 27; Hel. 15: 8 (5-16).">they</a> would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all <sup>b</sup><a href="3_ne/6/14b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Dedication; TG Diligence.">diligence</a> to keep the commandments of the Lord.
