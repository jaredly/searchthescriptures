Amalickiah conspires to be king—Moroni raises the title of liberty—He rallies the people to defend their religion—True believers are called Christians—A remnant of Joseph shall be preserved—Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to the land of Nephi—Those who will not support the cause of freedom are put to death.

And</span> it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 45: 20.">words</a> of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.

And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them.

Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 49: 25.">Amalickiah</a>.

And Amalickiah was desirous to be a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 2: 2.">king</a>; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/46/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 29: 11 (11-44).">judges</a> of the land, and they were seeking for power.

And they had been led by the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Prov. 29: 5.">flatteries</a> of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 46: 38.">high</a> priests over the church.

Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Tyranny.">destroy</a> the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/46/10b" mark="b" type="C" title="2 Ne. 1: 7; Mosiah 29: 32; TG Liberty.">liberty</a> which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/46/10c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 45: 15 (15-16); Alma 62: 40.">righteous</a>’ sake.

And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 16.">chief</a> commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.

And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.

Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/46/30a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 51.">strength</a>; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.
