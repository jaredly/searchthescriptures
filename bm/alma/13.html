Men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works—They are to teach the commandments—Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord—Melchizedek was one of these—Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land—They will reveal the actual coming of Christ.

And</span> again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/13/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 23 (11, 23); D&C 84: 17 (17-19); Moses 6: 7; Abr. 2: 9 (9, 11).">ordained</a> priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.

And those priests were ordained after the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/13/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 107: 3 (2-4).">order</a> of his Son, in a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/13/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 13: 16.">manner</a> that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.

And thus they have been <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/13/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 12: 10.">called</a> to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/13/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Spiritual Blindness.">blindness</a> of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/13/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="1 Ne. 17: 35 (32-35).">privilege</a> as their brethren.
