Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection—or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/40/2a" mark="a" type="C" title="Mosiah 16: 10 (10-13); TG Immortality.">immortality</a>, this corruption does not <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/40/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Cor. 15: 53 (42-54).">put</a> on incorruption—<sup>c</sup><a href="alma/40/2c" mark="c" type="A" title="1 Cor. 15: 20 (20-23).">until</a> after the coming of Christ.

Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/40/3b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Mysteries of Godliness.">mysteries</a> which are <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/40/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="D&C 25: 4; D&C 121: 26; D&C 124: 41.">kept</a>, that no one knoweth them save God himself.

Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/40/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="John 5: 29 (28-29).">come</a> forth from the dead.  Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed.

Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection.  And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.

Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection.  Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/40/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 40: 11.">raising</a> of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.

Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/40/17a" mark="a" type="C" title="D&C 76: 17 (17, 32, 50); TG Judgment, The Last.">consignation</a> to happiness or misery.
