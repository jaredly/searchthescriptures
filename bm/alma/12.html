CHAPTER 12

<div class="summary">
Alma contends with Zeezrom—The mysteries of God can be given only to the faithful—Men are judged by their thoughts, beliefs, words, and works—The wicked shall suffer a spiritual death—This mortal life is a probationary state—The plan of redemption brings to pass the resurrection and, through faith, a remission of sins—The repentant have a claim on mercy through the Only Begotten Son.

Now</span> Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/12/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 11: 36 (20-38).">lying</a> and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/12/1b" mark="b" type="C" title="Alma 62: 45; D&C 6: 11; D&C 18: 44; TG Conscience.">consciousness</a> of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;3 
Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/12/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 2: 5; D&C 6: 16.">thoughts</a>, and thou seest that thy <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/12/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 10: 17.">thoughts</a> are made known unto us by his Spirit;

Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/12/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 14: 2.">knew</a> the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.

And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God.  And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/12/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 12: 2.">just</a> and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/12/8b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Judgment, The Last.">judged</a> according to their works?
