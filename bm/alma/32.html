Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions had humbled them—Faith is a hope in that which is not seen which is true—Alma testifies that angels minister to men, women, and children—Alma compares the word unto a seed—It must be planted and nourished—Then it grows into a tree from which the fruit of eternal life is picked.

And</span> it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.

Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/32/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Luke 18: 9.">dross</a>; therefore they were <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/32/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 34: 40.">poor</a> as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.

Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/32/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 47: 5.">Onidah</a>, there came a great <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/32/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Assembly for Worship.">multitude</a> unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/32/4c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Poor in Spirit.">poor</a> in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.
