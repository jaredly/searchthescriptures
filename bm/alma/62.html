And</span> now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 60: 18.">traitor</a> to the freedom and cause of his country.

But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had rebelled against their country and also their God.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="3"></a>
<div id="alma/62/3" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3 
And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.
</div>

And he did raise the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 46: 36 (12-13, 36).">standard</a> of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/62/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Liberty.">liberty</a> in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="5"></a>
<div id="alma/62/5" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
And it came to pass that thousands did <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 61: 6.">flock</a> unto his standard, and did take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage.

<div id="alma/62/6" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 61: 8 (4-8).">king</a> of those dissenters who had driven the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/62/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 51: 6 (6-7).">freemen</a> out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>
<div id="alma/62/7" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7 
And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>
<div id="alma/62/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8 
And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;9 
And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 51: 19.">cast</a> into prison; and they were <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/62/9b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Capital Punishment.">executed</a> according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/62/9c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 51: 5 (5, 17, 21); Alma 60: 16.">king</a>-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="alma/62/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 2: 46.">executed</a> according to the law.

And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 44: 7; Alma 57: 19.">inflicted</a> death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.

<div id="alma/62/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
And it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.

<div id="alma/62/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum.  And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="alma/62/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards the land of Nephihah, being determined to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 59: 11 (5-11).">overthrow</a> the Lamanites in that city.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="alma/62/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="alma/62/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to enter into a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 44: 15, 20; 3 Ne. 5: 4.">covenant</a> that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="alma/62/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 47: 29.">dwell</a> with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="alma/62/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 50: 14; Alma 51: 26 (24-26).">Nephihah</a>.  And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>
<div id="alma/62/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in that day.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="alma/62/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>
<div id="alma/62/21" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and they were all asleep.  And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused that they should prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 49: 13 (13, 18-24).">wall</a> into the inner part of the wall.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="22"></a>
<div id="alma/62/22" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;22 
And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/22a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 55: 16.">themselves</a> down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="23"></a>
<div id="alma/62/23" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;23 
And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the city.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="24"></a>
<div id="alma/62/24" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;24 
And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="25"></a>
<div id="alma/62/25" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;25 
And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="26"></a>
<div id="alma/62/26" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;26 
Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/26a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 59: 8.">possession</a> of the city of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="27"></a>
<div id="alma/62/27" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;27 
Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners were desirous to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/27a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 24: 26 (25-27).">join</a> the people of Ammon and become a free people.

<div class="verse"><a name="29"></a>
<div id="alma/62/29" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;29 
Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites.

<div class="verse"><a name="30"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;30 
Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly; therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/30a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 50: 15; Alma 51: 26 (24-26).">Lehi</a>.

And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of Moroni.

<div class="verse"><a name="32"></a>
<div id="alma/62/32" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;32 
And it came to pass that <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/32a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 50: 13; Alma 51: 22 (22-23); 3 Ne. 8: 9.">Moroni</a> and his army did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="33"></a>
<div id="alma/62/33" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;33 
And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni.  Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="34"></a>
<div id="alma/62/34" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;34 
And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="35"></a>
<div id="alma/62/35" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;35 
And thus they did encamp for the night.  For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/35a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 48: 1.">cause</a> of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;36 
And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city.  And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/36a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 51: 34.">cast</a> a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart.  But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him.

<div class="verse"><a name="37"></a>
<div id="alma/62/37" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;37 
Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/62/37a" mark="a" type="E" title="IE throughout the Amalickiah-Ammoron wars; Alma 50: 35; Alma 51: 29-34; Alma 52; Alma 61; Alma 62: 3-37.">fought</a> valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions.

<div class="verse"><a name="38"></a>
<div id="alma/62/38" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;38 
Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites.
