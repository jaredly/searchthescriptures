And</span> it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 14: 23; Alma 16: 2 (2-3, 9, 11).">Ammonihah</a>, who had been <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/15/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 14: 7.">cast</a> out and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma.

And they related unto them all that had happened unto their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 14: 8 (8-14).">wives</a> and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/15/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 14: 28 (26-29).">power</a> of deliverance.

And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 14: 7 (6-7).">wickedness</a>, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his iniquity.  And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.

Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.

And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 14: 6.">exceedingly</a> sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.

And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mark 9: 23.">Believest</a> thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?

And when Alma had said these words, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Acts 3: 8 (1-11).">Zeezrom</a> leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.

But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/15/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 12: 24 (24-27).">ascribing</a> all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/15/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 1: 15 (2-15).">Nehor</a>, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.
