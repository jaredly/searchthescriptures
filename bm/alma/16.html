And</span> it came to pass in the *eleventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.

For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/16/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 15: 1 (1, 15-16); Alma 49: 3 (1-15).">Ammonihah</a>, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.

And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/16/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 9: 18.">destroyed</a> the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.

Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)—now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Lamanites.

And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken captive.

And it was called Desolation of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/16/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 1: 15; Alma 2: 1 (1, 20); Alma 24: 28 (28-30).">Nehors</a>; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.
