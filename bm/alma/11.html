Nephite coinage set forth—Amulek contends with Zeezrom—Christ will not save people in their sins—Only those who inherit the kingdom of heaven are saved—All men shall rise in immortality—There is no death after the resurrection.  About 82 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

Now</span> it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/11/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Wages.">wages</a> <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/11/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 10: 32.">according</a> to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.

Now if a man owed another, and he would not <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/11/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Justice.">pay</a> that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.

Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value.  And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/11/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="BD Money.">manner</a> of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/11/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 29: 41 (40-44).">established</a> by king Mosiah.
