Mortality is a probationary time to enable man to repent and serve God—The fall brought temporal and spiritual death upon all mankind—Redemption comes through repentance—God himself atoneth for the sins of the world—Mercy is for those who repent—All others are subject to God’s justice—Mercy cometh because of the atonement—Only the truly penitent are saved.

And</span> now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand—which is concerning the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/42/1a" mark="a" type="C" title="Mosiah 15: 27; TG God, Justice of.">justice</a> of God in the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/42/1b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Punishment.">punishment</a> of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/42/1c" mark="c" type="C" title="Rom. 3: 5; 2 Ne. 26: 7; TG Injustice.">injustice</a> that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.

Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee.  For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/42/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Eden.">Eden</a>, to till the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/42/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Jacob 2: 21; Mosiah 2: 25; Morm. 9: 17.">ground</a>, from whence they were taken—yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/42/2c" mark="c" type="A" title="Gen. 3: 24; Alma 12: 21; Moses 4: 31.">cherubim</a>, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life—

Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/42/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Cherubim.">cherubim</a> and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit—
