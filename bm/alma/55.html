Moroni refuses to exchange prisoners—The Lamanite guards are enticed to become drunk, and the Nephite prisoners are freed—The city of Gid is taken without bloodshed.  About 63 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

Now</span> it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Neh. 6: 8; Alma 47: 30 (12-35).">fraud</a>; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi.

And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 54: 13.">purpose</a>, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="3"></a>
<div id="alma/55/3" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3 
Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="4"></a>
<div id="alma/55/4" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="5"></a>
<div id="alma/55/5" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he was <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 47: 29.">one</a> of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="6"></a>
<div id="alma/55/6" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>
<div id="alma/55/7" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7 
Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 51: 26.">Gid</a>; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>
<div id="alma/55/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8 
And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite.  Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="9"></a>
<div id="alma/55/9" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9 
Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="alma/55/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle.  But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="11"></a>
<div id="alma/55/11" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>
<div id="alma/55/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="alma/55/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/13a" mark="a" type="C" title="Prov. 20: 1; TG Wine.">strength</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="alma/55/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 22: 6 (6-11).">drunken</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="alma/55/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 26: 12; Mosiah 24: 19.">deep</a> sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="alma/55/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
And now this was according to the design of Moroni.  And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 62: 22 (21-23).">weapons</a> of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="alma/55/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="alma/55/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>
<div id="alma/55/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/19a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 48: 16; Alma 55: 30 (30-32).">delight</a> in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="alma/55/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>
<div id="alma/55/21" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="22"></a>
<div id="alma/55/22" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;22 
Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="23"></a>
<div id="alma/55/23" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;23 
And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/23a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 52: 19; Alma 56: 12.">captains</a> demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/55/23b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 52: 38.">cast</a> them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="24"></a>
<div id="alma/55/24" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;24 
Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni.  He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="25"></a>
<div id="alma/55/25" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;25 
And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/25a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 53: 5 (3-5).">labor</a> in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="26"></a>
<div id="alma/55/26" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;26 
And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="27"></a>
<div id="alma/55/27" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;27 
And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="28"></a>
<div id="alma/55/28" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;28 
And it came to pass that the Nephites began <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/28a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 44: 20 (12-23).">again</a> to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="29"></a>
<div id="alma/55/29" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;29 
Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="30"></a>
<div id="alma/55/30" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;30 
And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="31"></a>
<div id="alma/55/31" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;31 
But behold, the Nephites were not slow to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/31a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hosea 5: 15; Alma 62: 49 (49-51).">remember</a> the Lord their God in this their time of affliction.  They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="32"></a>
<div id="alma/55/32" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;32 
And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="33"></a>
<div id="alma/55/33" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;33 
And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/55/33a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 50: 25; Alma 51: 26.">Morianton</a>; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="34"></a>
<div id="alma/55/34" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="35"></a>
<div id="alma/55/35" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
