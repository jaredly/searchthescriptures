Lamanite aggressions spread—The seed of the priests of Noah perish as Abinadi prophesied—Many Lamanites are converted and join the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They believe in Christ and keep the law of Moses.  Between 90 and 77 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 24: 24 (20-25).">no</a> more attempt to slay the people of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 27: 2.">Anti</a>-Nephi-Lehi at that time.

But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 16; Alma 16: 9.">destroyed</a> them.

And after that, they had <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 27: 1.">many</a> battles with the Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain.

And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 35.">seed</a> of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by the hands of the Nephites;

And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/5a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Authority.">authority</a> over the Lamanites, caused that many of the Lamanites should <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 17: 15.">perish</a> by fire because of their belief—

For many of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/6a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE the Lamanites.">them</a>, after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 21: 9 (5-12).">words</a> which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/25/6c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 26: 24.">traditions</a> of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness.

And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the children of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 21: 3 (2-4); Alma 24: 1 (1, 28-30).">Amulon</a> caused that they should be put to <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/7b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Martyrdom.">death</a>, yea, all those that believed in these things.

Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 17: 18.">hunt</a> the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.

And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites.  Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire.

And now Abinadi was the first that suffered <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 17: 13 (13-20).">death</a> by fire because of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.

And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.

And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 22: 1 (1, 4).">Ishmael</a> and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/13b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 24: 1 (1-3, 5, 20); Alma 27: 21 (2, 21, 25).">Anti</a>-Nephi-Lehi.

Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled.  But notwithstanding the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 4: 5; Jarom 1: 11.">law</a> of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/25/15b" mark="b" type="C" title="Mosiah 16: 14; TG Jesus Christ, Types of, in Anticipation.">type</a> of his coming, and believing that they must keep those <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/25/15c" mark="c" type="A" title="Josh. 1: 8; Mosiah 3: 14 (14-15); Mosiah 13: 29 (29-32); D&C 41: 5 (4-5).">outward</a> <sup>d</sup><a href="alma/25/15d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Ordinance.">performances</a> until the time that he should be revealed unto them.

And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/25/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 9 (7-11).">prayers</a>, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every particular.
