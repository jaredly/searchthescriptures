Behold,</span> now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/23/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 22: 27.">proclamation</a> among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their land.

Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/23/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 21: 20 (4-6, 20); Alma 26: 29.">synagogues</a>, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/23/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Hel. 3: 14 (9, 14).">sanctuaries</a>.

And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/23/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 22: 23.">all</a> his <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/23/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 18: 19.">household</a>; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/23/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 26: 24.">traditions</a> of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness.
