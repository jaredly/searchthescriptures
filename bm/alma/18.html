<div class="summary">
King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is the Great Spirit—Ammon teaches the king of the creation, of God’s dealings with men, and of the redemption that comes through Christ—Lamoni believes and falls to the earth as if dead.  About 90 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 19: 15.">servants</a> should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter.

And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 22: 9 (9-11).">great</a> power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.  Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="3"></a>
<div id="alma/18/3" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3 
And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 36 (34-38).">cannot</a> be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/18/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 17: 27; Alma 19: 21 (20-21).">scatter</a> the king’s flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/18/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 22: 20.">great</a> strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king.  And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="4"></a>
<div id="alma/18/4" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4 
And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 28 (28-31).">slay</a> you as I did your brethren.  Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="5"></a>
<div id="alma/18/5" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
Now this was the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 15; Alma 60: 32.">tradition</a> of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/18/5b" mark="b" type="C" title="Alma 19: 25 (25-27); TG God, Knowledge about.">Great</a> Spirit.  Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/18/5c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 30: 17.">whatsoever</a> they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="6"></a>
<div id="alma/18/6" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>
<div id="alma/18/7" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7 
Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 26; Alma 19: 20 (20-21).">waters</a> of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>
<div id="alma/18/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8 
And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="9"></a>
<div id="alma/18/9" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9 
And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Enos 1: 21; Alma 20: 6.">horses</a>. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/18/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 20: 9 (9, 12).">great</a> <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/18/9c" mark="c" type="A" title="Esth. 1: 3.">feast</a> appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="alma/18/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 20: 6; 3 Ne. 3: 22.">chariots</a> he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="11"></a>
<div id="alma/18/11" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>
<div id="alma/18/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 5: 6.">countenance</a> of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="alma/18/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And one of the king’s servants said unto him, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="John 20: 16.">Rabbanah</a>, which is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="alma/18/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king?  And the king answered him not for the space of an <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 8: 19.">hour</a>, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="alma/18/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me?  But the king answered him not.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="alma/18/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 41: 38; 1 Ne. 1: 12; Mosiah 27: 24.">Spirit</a> of God, therefore he perceived the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/18/16b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 12: 3.">thoughts</a> of the king.  And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/18/16c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 17: 36.">seven</a> of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="alma/18/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?  Behold, I am a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 2: 30.">man</a>, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="alma/18/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/18a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Discernment, Spiritual.">discern</a> his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou?  Art thou that Great Spirit, who <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/18/18b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG God, Omniscience of.">knows</a> all things?
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>

Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.

<div id="alma/18/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?  Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks—

<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>

And now, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 5: 16.">if</a> thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.

Now Ammon being <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/18/22a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 41: 39; Alma 48: 11 (11-17).">wise</a>, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things?  And this is the thing that I desire of thee.
