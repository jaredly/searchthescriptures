I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/10/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 5: 16.">writing</a> which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.

As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/10/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 20.">angel</a> of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/10/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 5: 46; Alma 6: 6.">fasted</a> many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/10/7c" mark="c" type="C" title="Acts 10: 30 (30-35); TG Hospitality.">receive</a> him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.
