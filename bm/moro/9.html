My</span> beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.

For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in which we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men.

And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall destroy this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth them up continually to <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/9/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Anger.">anger</a> one with another.

Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of God with <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/9/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 1: 26 (26-27); W of M 1: 17; D&C 121: 43 (41-43).">sharpness</a> they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they <sup>b</sup><a href="moro/9/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Hardheartedness.">harden</a> their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased <sup>c</sup><a href="moro/9/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="Moro. 8: 28; D&C 1: 33.">striving</a> with them.

For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they have no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and they <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/9/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 4: 11 (11-12).">thirst</a> after blood and revenge continually.

And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/9/6a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Dedication; TG Diligence; TG Perseverance.">diligently</a>; for if we should cease to <sup>b</sup><a href="moro/9/6b" mark="b" type="C" title="1 Sam. 8: 9; 2 Cor. 5: 9; Jacob 1: 19; Enos 1: 20; TG Duty; TG Priesthood, Magnifying Callings within.">labor</a>, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.

And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this people.  For according to the knowledge which I have received from Amoron, behold, the Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children.

And notwithstanding this great <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/9/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Body, Sanctity of.">abomination</a> of the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum.
