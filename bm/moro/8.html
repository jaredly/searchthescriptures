An</span> epistle of my <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/8/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="W of M 1: 1.">father</a> Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me soon after my calling to the ministry.  And on this wise did he write unto me, saying:

I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/8/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 34: 6 (5-7); Mosiah 4: 11.">goodness</a> and <sup>b</sup><a href="moro/8/3b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Grace.">grace</a>, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end.

For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter.  And the <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/8/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Word of the Lord.">word</a> of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:
