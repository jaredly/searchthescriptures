Now</span> I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/1/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 8: 5; Moro. 10: 1 (1-2).">not</a> to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.

For behold, their <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/1/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 12: 21 (20-23).">wars</a> are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because of their <sup>b</sup><a href="moro/1/2b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Hate.">hatred</a> they <sup>c</sup><a href="moro/1/2c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 45: 14.">put</a> to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

And I, Moroni, will not <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/1/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 10: 33 (32-33); 3 Ne. 29: 5.">deny</a> the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.

Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of <sup>a</sup><a href="moro/1/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 3: 12 (11-12, 19).">worth</a> unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.
