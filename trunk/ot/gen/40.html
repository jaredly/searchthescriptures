And</span> it came to pass after these things, <i>that</i> the butler of the king of Egypt and <i>his</i> baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the <sup>a</sup><a href="gen/40/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 39: 20.">prison</a>, the place where Joseph <i>was</i> bound.

And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they <i>were</i> sad.

And they said unto him, We have dreamed a <sup>a</sup><a href="gen/40/8a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Dreams.">dream</a>, and <i>there is</i> no interpreter of it.  And Joseph said unto them, <i>Do</i> not <sup>b</sup><a href="gen/40/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ps. 105: 19; Dan. 2: 28; 2 Pet. 1: 20 (20, 21); 1 Ne. 11: 11 (3-11).">interpretations</a> <i>belong</i> to God?  tell me <i>them,</i> I pray you.

And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine <i>was</i> before me;

And in the vine <i>were</i> three branches: and it <i>was</i> as though it budded, <i>and</i> her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:

And Pharaoh’s cup <i>was</i> in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.

<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>

And Joseph said unto him, This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three branches <i>are</i> three days:

Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also <i>was</i> in my dream, and, behold, <i>I had</i> three white baskets on my head:

Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
