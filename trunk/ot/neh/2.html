And</span> it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that</i> wine <i>was</i> before him: and I took up the wine, and gave <i>it</i> unto the king.  Now I had not been <i>beforetime</i> sad in his presence.

Wherefore the king said unto me, Why <i>is</i> thy countenance sad, seeing thou <i>art</i> not sick?  this <i>is</i> nothing <i>else</i> but sorrow of heart.  Then I was very sore afraid,

And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/2/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ps. 137: 4.">sad</a>, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, <i>lieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.

Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/2/7a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE on the west side of the Euphrates River.">beyond</a> the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which <i>appertained</i> to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.  And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

&#182; And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I <i>any</i> man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither <i>was there any</i> beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me.  And they said, Let us rise up and build.  So they strengthened their hands for <i>this </i>good <i>work.</i>
