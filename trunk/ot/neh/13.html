Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/13/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Num. 22: 5; Num. 23: 11.">Balaam</a> against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/13/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 12: 38.">mixed</a> multitude.

&#182; And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, <i>was</i> allied unto Tobiah:

And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded <i>to be given</i> to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

But in all this <i>time</i> was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.

And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them <i>was</i> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office <i>was</i> to distribute unto their brethren.

&#182; In those days saw I in Judah <i>some</i> treading wine presses on the <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/13/15a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Sabbath.">sabbath</a>, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all <i>manner of</i> burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified <i>against them</i> in the day wherein they sold <sup>b</sup><a href="neh/13/15b" mark="b" type="D" title="OR supplies.">victuals</a>.

And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and <i>some</i> of my servants set I at the gates, <i>that</i> there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
