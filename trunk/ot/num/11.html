Fire from the Lord consumes rebels in Israel—Israel murmurs and lusts for flesh instead of manna—Moses complains that he cannot bear the burden alone—He is commanded to choose seventy elders to assist him—The Lord promises flesh until Israel is surfeited therewith—The seventy elders chosen; they prophesy; the Lord comes down; Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp—Israel surfeited with quail—They lust, a great plague follows, and many die.
