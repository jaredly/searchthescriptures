Now</span> it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of <sup>a</sup><a href="1_chr/19/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 10: 1 (1-19).">Ammon</a> died, and his son reigned in his stead.

And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me.  And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.  So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.

Then there went <i>certain,</i> and told David how the men were served.  And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed.  And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.

&#182; And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.

So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before <sup>a</sup><a href="1_chr/19/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 13: 9 (9, 16).">Medeba</a>.  And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come <i>were </i>by themselves in the field.

Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.

So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
