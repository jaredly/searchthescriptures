All the riches and wealth of the king were vanity and vexation of spirit—Wisdom excelleth folly—God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to man.

I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i>was</i> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

I made me great works; I <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 7: 1 (1-12).">builded</a> me houses; I planted me vineyards:

I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <i>kind</i> <i>of</i> fruits:

I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:

I got <i>me</i> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

<div id="eccl/2/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8 
I gathered me also silver and <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 9: 28; 1 Kgs. 10: 10 (10-14).">gold</a>, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the <sup>b</sup><a href="eccl/2/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 20: 14.">provinces</a>: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <i>as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.

So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Eccl. 3: 22; Eccl. 5: 18; Eccl. 9: 9.">labour</a>.

Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <i>was</i> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <i>there was</i> no profit under the sun.

&#182; And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <i>can</i> the man <i>do</i> that cometh after the king?  <i>even</i> that which hath been already done.

Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/13a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Darkness, Spiritual.">darkness</a>.

The wise man’s eyes <i>are</i> in his head; but the fool walketh in <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Prov. 17: 24.">darkness</a>: and I myself perceived also that one <sup>b</sup><a href="eccl/2/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="Eccl. 9: 2.">event</a> happeneth to them all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Eccl. 6: 11.">wise</a>?  Then I said in my heart, that this also <i>is</i> vanity.

For <i>there is</i> no <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Eccl. 3: 19.">remembrance</a> of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <i>is</i> in the days to come shall all be forgotten.  And how <sup>b</sup><a href="eccl/2/16b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ps. 49: 10.">dieth</a> the wise <i>man?</i>  as the fool.

Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun <i>is</i> grievous unto me: for all <i>is</i> vanity and <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Eccl. 1: 14.">vexation</a> of spirit.

And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <i>man</i> or a fool?  yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.  This <i>is</i> also vanity.

<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>

Therefore I went about to cause my heart to <sup>a</sup><a href="eccl/2/20a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Despair.">despair</a> of all the labour which I took under the sun.
