Then</span> I looked, and, behold, in the <sup>a</sup><a href="ezek/10/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ezek. 1: 22.">firmament</a> that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a <sup>b</sup><a href="ezek/10/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ezek. 1: 26.">throne</a>.

And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <i>even</i> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and <sup>a</sup><a href="ezek/10/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Rev. 8: 5.">scatter</a> <i>them</i> over the city.

And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the <sup>a</sup><a href="ezek/10/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ezek. 1: 16.">wheels</a> <i>was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone.
