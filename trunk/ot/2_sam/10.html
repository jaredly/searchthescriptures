And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  hath not David <i>rather</i> sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

&#182; And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/10/6a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB men of Tob (a land mentioned in Judg. 11: 3).">Ish</a>-tob twelve thousand men.
