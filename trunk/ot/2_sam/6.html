And David arose, and went with all the people that <i>were</i> with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/6/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 13: 13 (6-14).">ark</a> of God, whose name is called by the name of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> of hosts that dwelleth <i>between</i> the <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/6/2b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Cherubim.">cherubims</a>.

&#182; And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth <i>his hand </i>to the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/6/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 85: 8.">ark</a> of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook <i>it.</i>

And the anger of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> was kindled against <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/6/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 15: 2.">Uzzah</a>; and God <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/6/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Num. 1: 51; 1 Sam. 6: 19.">smote</a> him there for <i>his</i> error; and there he died by the ark of God.
