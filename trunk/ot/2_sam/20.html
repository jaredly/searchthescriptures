And</span> there happened to be there a man of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/20/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Deut. 13: 13.">Belial</a>, whose name <i>was</i> Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.

&#182; And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women <i>his</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/20/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 1: 15.">concubines</a>, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them.

&#182; Then said the king to <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/20/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 19: 13.">Amasa</a>, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.

And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than <i>did</i> Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/20/6a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE fortified.">fenced</a> cities, and escape us.

When they <i>were</i> at the great stone which <i>is</i> in Gibeon, Amasa went before them.  And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle <i>with</i> a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
