And</span> it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth <i>to battle,</i> that David sent <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/11/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 20: 1.">Joab</a>, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.  But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

&#182; And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/11/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Covetousness.">saw</a> a woman washing herself; and the woman <i>was</i> very beautiful to <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/11/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="D&C 42: 23.">look</a> upon.

And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.  And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/11/8a" mark="a" type="E" title="IE a present of a portion of food; Gen. 43: 34.">a</a> mess <i>of meat </i>from the king.

And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from <i>thy</i> journey?  why <i>then</i> didst thou not go down unto thine house?

And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/11/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 12: 9.">smitten</a>, and die.
