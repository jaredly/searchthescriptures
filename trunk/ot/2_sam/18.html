And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.  And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

But the people answered, Thou shalt not <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/18/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 21: 17.">go</a> forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <i>thou art</i> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <i>it is</i> better that thou <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/18/3b" mark="b" type="P" title="HEB help us.">succour</a> us out of the city.

And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.  And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

And the king commanded <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/18/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 2: 5.">Joab</a> and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/18/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Sam. 18: 12."><i>Deal</i></a> gently for my sake with the young man, <i>even</i> with Absalom.

&#182; So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/18/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 17: 18 (15-18).">wood</a> of Ephraim;

&#182; And Absalom met the servants of David.  And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i>was</i> under him went away.

And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <i>him,</i> and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground?  and I would have given thee ten <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle.

And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <i>shekels</i> of silver in mine hand, <i>yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/18/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 18: 5.">charged</a> thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <i>touch</i> the young man Absalom.

Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i>me.</i>

Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee.  And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <i>was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak.

&#182; Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <i>is</i> in the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/18/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 14: 17.">king</a>’s dale: for he said, I have no <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/18/18b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Sam. 14: 27.">son</a> to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s <sup>c</sup><a href="2_sam/18/18c" mark="c" type="D" title="OR monument.">place</a>.
