And</span> Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.  And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s <i>children,</i> saying,

And he that <i>was </i>over the house, and he that <i>was</i> over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up <i>of the children,</i> sent to Jehu, saying, We <i>are </i>thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou <i>that which is</i> good in thine eyes.

Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye <i>be</i> mine, and <i>if</i> ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.  Now the king’s sons, <i>being</i> seventy persons, <i>were</i> with the great men of the city, which brought them up.

Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice <i>to do</i> to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.
