Naaman, the Syrian, comes to Elisha to be healed of leprosy—He rejects the prophet’s instruction, but relents and dips himself in Jordan seven times; he is healed—Elisha refuses to accept a reward—Gehazi accepts a gift from Naaman and is cursed with leprosy.

Now</span> Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, <i>but he was</i> a <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Leprosy.">leper</a>.

And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.

And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel.  And he departed, and <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 9: 7.">took</a> with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand <i>pieces</i> of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have <i>therewith</i> sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, <i>Am</i> I <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 30: 2.">God</a>, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?  wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he <sup>b</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 20: 7.">seeketh</a> a quarrel against me.

&#182; And it was <i>so,</i> when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes?  let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 29 (29-30).">prophet</a> in Israel.

But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 31: 7.">according</a> to the saying of the man of God: and his <sup>b</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="Job 33: 25.">flesh</a> came again like unto the <sup>c</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/14c" mark="c" type="A" title="Luke 4: 27.">flesh</a> of a little child, and he was <sup>d</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/14d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Administrations to the Sick; TG Healing.">clean</a>.

&#182; And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 24: 27.">know</a> that <i>there is</i> no <sup>b</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Dan. 2: 47.">God</a> in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a <sup>c</sup><a href="2_kgs/5/15c" mark="c" type="A" title="Gen. 14: 21 (21-24).">blessing</a> of thy servant.

&#182; But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, <i>as</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
