In</span> the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing <i>was</i> true, but the time appointed <i>was</i> long: and he understood the thing, and had <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/10/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 1: 17 (6-20).">understanding</a> of the vision.

Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/10/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 12: 6; Rev. 1: 13.">clothed</a> in linen, whose loins <i>were</i> girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
