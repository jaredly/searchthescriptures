&#182; But the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty <sup>a</sup><a href="jonah/1/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 8: 24; 1 Ne. 18: 13 (9-13).">tempest</a> in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that <i>were</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten <i>it</i> of them.  But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper?  arise, <sup>a</sup><a href="jonah/1/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 18: 21 (15-22).">call</a> upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
