And he prayed unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, and said, I pray thee, O <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, <i>was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?  Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and <sup>a</sup><a href="jonah/4/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Mercy.">merciful</a>, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and <sup>b</sup><a href="jonah/4/2b" mark="b" type="P" title="HEB relentest; i.e. Jonah knew that God could revoke the calamity decreed, but expected he would do so even without the repentance of the people.">repentest</a> thee of the evil.

So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a <sup>a</sup><a href="jonah/4/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR shelter.">booth</a>, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
