So</span> Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.  In his days the land was quiet ten years.

For he took away the altars of the strange <i>gods,</i> and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/14/3a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE idolatrous wooden objects associated with fertility worship.">groves</a>:

&#182; And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> had given him rest.

Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <i>them</i> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <i>while</i> the land <i>is</i> yet before us; because we have sought the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> our God, we have sought <i>him,</i> and he hath given us rest on every side.  So they built and prospered.

And Asa had an army <i>of men</i> that bare <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/14/8a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR large shields.">targets</a> and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <i>were</i> mighty men of valour.

And Asa cried unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> his God, and said, <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, <i>it is</i> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.  O <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, thou <i>art</i> our God; let not man prevail against thee.

And Asa and the people that <i>were</i> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
