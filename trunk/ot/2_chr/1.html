So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/1/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 16: 39.">high</a> place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon; for there was the <sup>b</sup><a href="2_chr/1/3b" mark="b" type="R" title="HEB tent of meeting (also v. 13); TG Temple.">tabernacle</a> of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> had made in the wilderness.

And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
