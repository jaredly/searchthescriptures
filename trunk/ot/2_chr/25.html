But he slew not their children, but <i>did</i> as <i>it is</i> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/25/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Accountability.">sin</a>.

&#182; Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of <i>their</i> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice <i>men, able</i> to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> <i>is</i> not with Israel, <i>to wit, with</i> all the children of Ephraim.

But if thou wilt go, do <i>it,</i> be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/25/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 60: 4.">power</a> to help, and to cast down.

And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?  And the man of God answered, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> is able to give thee much more than this.

Then Amaziah separated them, <i>to wit,</i> the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.

&#182; And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/25/11a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE by the Dead Sea.">valley</a> of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

&#182; Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up <i>to be</i> his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

&#182; Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/25/17a" mark="a" type="E" title="IE let us face each other on the battle field; cp; 2 Sam. 2: 12-16.">let</a> us see one another in the face.
