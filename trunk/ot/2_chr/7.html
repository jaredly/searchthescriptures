Now</span> when Solomon had made an end of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/7/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 8: 54.">praying</a>, the <sup>b</sup><a href="2_chr/7/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Lev. 9: 24; 1 Chr. 21: 26.">fire</a> came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> filled the house.

And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/7/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Assembly for Worship.">worshipped</a>, and praised the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, <i>saying,</i> For <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.

&#182; Then the king and all the people <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/7/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 8: 62 (62-66).">offered</a> sacrifices before the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>.

And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, which David the king had made to praise the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, because his mercy <i>endureth </i>for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that <i>was</i> before the house of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.
