&#182; He walked also after their counsel, and went with <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/22/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 8: 28.">Jehoram</a> the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/22/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 9: 27.">slain</a> him, they buried him: Because, said they, he <i>is</i> the <sup>b</sup><a href="2_chr/22/9b" mark="b" type="D" title="OR grandson.">son</a> of Jehoshaphat, who sought the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> with all his heart.

So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
