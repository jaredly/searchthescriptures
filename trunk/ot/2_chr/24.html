And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.  Howbeit the Levites hastened <i>it</i> not.

And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/24/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 30: 16 (12-16).">collection</a>, <i>according to the commandment</i> of Moses the servant of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, and of the congregation of Israel, for the <sup>b</sup><a href="2_chr/24/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Num. 1: 53 (50-53).">tabernacle</a> of witness?

Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that <i>there was</i> much <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/24/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 12: 10.">money</a>, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again.

And when they had finished <i>it,</i> they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/24/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 12: 13.">vessels</a> for the house of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, <i>even</i> vessels to minister, and to offer <i>withal,</i> and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.
