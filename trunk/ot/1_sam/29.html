Now</span> the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/29/1a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR spring.">fountain</a> which <i>is</i> in Jezreel.

Then said the princes of the Philistines, What <i>do</i> these Hebrews <i>here?</i>  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, <i>Is</i> not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell <i>unto</i> me unto this day?

And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/29/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 12: 19.">adversary</a> to us: for wherewith should he <sup>b</sup><a href="1_sam/29/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Reconciliation.">reconcile</a> himself unto his master?  <i>should it</i> not <i>be</i> with the heads of these men?

&#182; Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, <i>as</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host <i>is</i> good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou <i>art</i> good in my sight, as an <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/29/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Angels.">angel</a> of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
