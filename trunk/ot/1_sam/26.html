David again spares Saul’s life—He again refuses to stretch forth his hand against the Lord’s anointed—Saul and David separate.

And</span> the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, <i>which is</i> before Jeshimon?

Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> before Jeshimon, by the way.  But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.

&#182; And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE barricade.">trench</a>, and the people pitched round about him.

<div class="verse"><a name="6"></a>

Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?  And <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 2: 18.">Abishai</a> said, I will go down with thee.

<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/7" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7 
So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/7a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE the place of his head.">his</a> bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8 
Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not <i>smite</i> him the second time.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="9"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/9" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9 
And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 24: 10.">who</a> can stretch forth his hand against the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>’s anointed, and be guiltless?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
David said furthermore, <i>As</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth, the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> shall smite him; or his day shall come to <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 31: 5.">die</a>; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>’s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that <i>is</i> at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw <i>it,</i> nor knew <i>it,</i> neither awaked: for they <i>were</i> all asleep; because a <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 24: 19; Alma 55: 15 (15-16).">deep</a> sleep from the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> was fallen upon them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
&#182; Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space <i>being </i>between them:

<div id="1_sam/26/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner?  Then Abner answered and said, Who <i>art</i> thou <i>that</i> criest to the king?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And David said to Abner, <i>Art</i> not thou a <i>valiant</i> man?  and who <i>is</i> like to thee in Israel?  wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?  for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.

&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
This thing <i>is</i> not good that thou hast done.  <i>As</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth, ye <i>are</i> worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>’s anointed.  And now see where the king’s spear <i>is,</i> and the cruse of water that <i>was</i> at his bolster.

<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="1_sam/26/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, <i>Is</i> this thy voice, my son David?  And David said, <i>It is</i> my voice, my lord, O king.

And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done?  or what evil <i>is</i> in mine hand?

&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.  If the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if <i>they be</i> the children of men, cursed <i>be</i> they before the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, saying, Go, serve other gods.

Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

&#182; Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/26/21a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Life, Sanctity of.">precious</a> in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear!  and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.

Then Saul said to David, Blessed <i>be</i> thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great <i>things,</i> and also shalt still prevail.  So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
