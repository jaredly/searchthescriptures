And</span> it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which <i>were</i> on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which <i>were</i> by the sea, <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/5/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 15: 14.">heard</a> that the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their <sup>b</sup><a href="josh/5/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Josh. 2: 11.">heart</a> melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.

And this <i>is</i> the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, <i>that were</i> males, <i>even</i> all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people <i>that were</i> born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, <i>them</i> they had not circumcised.

For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people <i>that were</i> men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/5/6a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Disobedience.">obeyed</a> not the voice of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>: unto whom the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> sware that he would not shew them the <sup>b</sup><a href="josh/5/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Num. 14: 23.">land</a>, which the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> <sup>c</sup><a href="josh/5/6c" mark="c" type="D" title="OR covenanted.">sware</a> unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
