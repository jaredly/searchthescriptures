Now</span> in the twelfth month, that <i>is,</i> the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s <sup>a</sup><a href="esth/9/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Esth. 3: 13 (12-13).">commandment</a> and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)

The Jews <sup>a</sup><a href="esth/9/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Esth. 8: 11.">gathered</a> themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the <sup>b</sup><a href="esth/9/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Esth. 8: 17.">fear</a> of them fell upon all people.

For the Jews that <i>were</i> in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
