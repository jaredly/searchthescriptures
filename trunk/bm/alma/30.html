Korihor, the antichrist, ridicules Christ, the atonement, and the spirit of prophecy—He teaches that there is no God, no fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no Christ—Alma testifies that Christ shall come and that all things denote there is a God—Korihor demands a sign and is struck dumb—The devil had appeared to Korihor as an angel and taught him what to say—He is trodden down and dies.

Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered—but it came to pass after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/30/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 28: 6.">fasting</a>, and <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/30/2b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Mourning.">mourning</a>, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout all the land.

Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/30/49a" mark="a" type="A" title="Luke 1: 20; Acts 13: 11 (8-12).">struck</a> dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.

And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God?  In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign?  Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign?  Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?

And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/30/52a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Chr. 13: 20.">power</a> of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/30/52b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 30: 42 (41-42).">knew</a> that there was a God.

But behold, the devil hath <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/30/53a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 7: 14 (14, 18).">deceived</a> me; for he <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/30/53b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Ne. 9: 9.">appeared</a> unto me in the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/30/53c" mark="c" type="A" title="2 Cor. 11: 14.">form</a> of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God.
