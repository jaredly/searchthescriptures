Alma heads a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites—The Zoramites deny Christ, believe in a false concept of election, and worship with set prayers—The missionaries are filled with the Holy Spirit—Their afflictions are swallowed up in the joy of Christ.  About 74 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

Now</span> it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 20: 5; Mosiah 13: 13.">bow</a> down to dumb <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/31/1b" mark="b" type="C" title="2 Ne. 9: 37; TG Idolatry.">idols</a>, his heart again began to <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/31/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 35: 15.">sicken</a> because of the iniquity of the people.

Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 5 (5, 15, 22).">Antionum</a>, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/31/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 27: 22.">Jershon</a>, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.

Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Conspiracy.">correspondence</a> with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.

And now, as the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/5a" mark="a" type="C" title="Ex. 24: 7; Jonah 3: 5; Rom. 10: 17; Enos 1: 23; Alma 4: 19; TG Preaching.">preaching</a> of the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/31/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 22: 11; Heb. 4: 12; Jacob 2: 8; Alma 36: 26.">word</a> had a great tendency to <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/31/5c" mark="c" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 12; Alma 45: 21.">lead</a> the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.

Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/6a" mark="a" type="C" title="Hel. 5: 51 (50-52); D&C 11: 2; TG Gospel; Hel. 5: 41.">Amulek</a> and Zeezrom, who were at <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/31/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 8: 3; Alma 35: 13; Alma 45: 18.">Melek</a>; and he also took two of his sons.

Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 31: 32; Alma 35: 14.">Shiblon</a> and <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/31/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 39: 1.">Corianton</a>; and these are the names of those who went with him among the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/31/7c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 30: 59; Alma 38: 3.">Zoramites</a>, to preach unto them the word.

But they had <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Apostasy of Individuals.">fallen</a> into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.

<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="alma/31/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
Neither would they observe the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Ordinance.">performances</a> of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.

Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them.

Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/12a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Worship.">worship</a> after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;

<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>

For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person.

Therefore, whosoever desired to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/31/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 6: 5 (1-7).">worship</a> must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:

Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about.
