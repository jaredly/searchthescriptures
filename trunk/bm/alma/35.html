Now</span> it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 28: 1.">Jershon</a>.

Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 30: 59.">Zoramites</a>, also came over into the land of Jershon.

And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Priestcraft.">craft</a>; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.

And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 35: 14.">many</a>; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.

Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 27: 26.">people</a> of Ammon who were in Jershon, and the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/35/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 30: 59.">chief</a> ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land.

And he breathed out many threatenings against them.

And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/35/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 3.">account</a> shall be given of their wars hereafter.
