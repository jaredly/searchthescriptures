In the resurrection men come forth to a state of endless happiness or endless misery—Wickedness never was happiness—Carnal men are without God in the world—Every person receives again in the restoration the characteristics and attributes acquired in mortality.

And</span> now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/41/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Pet. 1: 20; Alma 13: 20.">wrested</a> the scriptures, and have gone far <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/41/1b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Apostasy of Individuals.">astray</a> because of this thing.  And I perceive that thy mind has been <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/41/1c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Problem-Solving.">worried</a> also concerning this thing.  But behold, I will explain it unto thee.

I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order.  Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/41/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 40: 23.">part</a> of the body should be restored to itself.

Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness.

And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?

O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/41/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 12: 10; Rev. 22: 12 (6-16).">evil</a> for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.
