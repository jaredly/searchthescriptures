Behold,</span> now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Deliverance.">delivered</a> them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/1b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Fasting.">fast</a> much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.

And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 37: 1 (1-32); Alma 50: 38.">records</a> which have been kept?

Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 4: 14; Alma 48: 15, 25.">prosper</a> thee in this land.

And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 12: 12 (10-15); Hel. 13: 9; Morm. 8: 6.">four</a> hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/10b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Apostasy of Individuals.">unbelief</a>.

Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall become <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 10; Hel. 13: 6 (5-19).">extinct</a>—

Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/12a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Lust.">lasciviousness</a>, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/12b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Ne. 26: 9; 3 Ne. 27: 32.">fourth</a> generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.

And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 3: 16.">no</a> more be numbered among the people of Nephi.

And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to Helaman, he <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 49: 1 (1-27); Alma 8: 22.">blessed</a> him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth for the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 46: 10; Alma 62: 40.">righteous</a>’ sake.

And when Alma had done this he <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 1: 3 (2-3).">departed</a> out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/18b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 35: 13.">Melek</a>.

Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/19a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs 2: 16.">Spirit</a>, or <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/19b" mark="b" type="C" title="Deut. 34: 6 (5-6); TG Translated Beings.">buried</a> by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses.

For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/45/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 31: 5.">word</a> of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/45/21b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 6: 7; Alma 62: 44 (44-47).">regulation</a> should be made throughout the church.
