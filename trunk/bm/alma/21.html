Now</span> when Ammon and his brethren <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 13 (13, 17).">separated</a> themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/21/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 24: 1; 3 Ne. 9: 7.">Jerusalem</a>, calling it after the land of their fathers’ nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.

Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 31, 24; Alma 24: 1 (1, 28-30); Alma 25: 7 (4-9).">Amulon</a> had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.

Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.

And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites.  And he began to preach to them in their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 66: 7.">synagogues</a>, for they had built synagogues after the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/21/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 1: 12 (2-15); Alma 14: 16; Alma 24: 28.">order</a> of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.

Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 16: 13.">synagogues</a> to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified?  Hast thou seen an <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/21/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 11 (11-15).">angel</a>?  Why do not angels appear unto us?

Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish.  How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts?  How knowest thou that we have cause to repent?

And the man said unto him: We do not <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 7: 2 (1-7).">believe</a> that thou knowest any such thing.

Now Aaron began to open the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 25: 6.">scriptures</a> unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/21/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 22: 14 (13-14).">no</a> redemption for mankind <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/21/9c" mark="c" type="A" title="Mosiah 5: 8; Alma 38: 9.">save</a> it were through the <sup>d</sup><a href="alma/21/9d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Jesus Christ, Death of.">death</a> and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.

And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them they were angry with him, and began to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Mocking.">mock</a> him; and they would not hear the words which he spake.

Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren.  And they contended with many about the word.

And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 23: 10.">Middoni</a>.  And they did preach the word unto many, and <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/21/12b" mark="b" type="A" title="Matt. 7: 14.">few</a> believed on the words which they taught.

Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/21/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 20: 2.">prison</a>, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.
