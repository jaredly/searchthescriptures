And</span> now, my <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/39/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 31: 7.">son</a>, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God?
