O that</span> I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak with the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/29/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Isa. 58: 1; D&C 29: 4.">trump</a> of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!

Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/29/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 26 (25-26); 3 Ne. 21: 20.">come</a> unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.

I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/29/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ps. 21: 2; Ps. 37: 4.">desire</a>, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/29/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Agency.">wills</a>, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.
