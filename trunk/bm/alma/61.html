Behold,</span> now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/61/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 50: 40.">Pahoran</a>, the chief governor.  And these are the words which he received:

I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army.  Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/61/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 60: 3 (3-9).">afflictions</a>, yea, it grieves my soul.

But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/61/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 58: 36; Alma 59: 13.">rebellion</a> against me, and also those of my people who are <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/61/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 51: 6 (6-7).">freemen</a>, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.

And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/61/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Flattery.">flattery</a>, and they have <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/61/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Peer Influence.">led</a> away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/61/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 51: 6 (6-7); Alma 62: 6.">freemen</a> that they have not come unto you.

And now, in your epistle you have <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/61/9a" mark="a" type="C" title="D&C 101: 5; TG Reproof.">censured</a> me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.
