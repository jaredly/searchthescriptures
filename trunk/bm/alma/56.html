And</span> now it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 58: 35.">Moroni</a> received an <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/56/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 59: 1.">epistle</a> from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/56/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 53: 22 (8, 22).">that</a> quarter of the land.

And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the land.

Behold, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 53: 22.">two</a> thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi—now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;

Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things—

&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.

And now ye also know concerning the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/6a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Covenants.">covenant</a> which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood.

But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 24: 18 (17-19); Alma 53: 13 (13-15).">break</a> the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.

But I would not suffer them that they should break this <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/8a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Honesty.">covenant</a> which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/56/8b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Vows.">oath</a> which they had taken.

But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the *twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 53: 22.">two</a> thousand young men to the city of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/56/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 57: 11.">Judea</a>, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="alma/56/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
And I did join my two thousand <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 56: 17.">sons</a>, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="11"></a>
<div id="alma/56/11" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 28: 12.">happy</a>.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="12"></a>
<div id="alma/56/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12 
And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 52: 19.">captains</a>, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="alma/56/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="alma/56/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
The land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 22.">Manti</a>, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/56/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 57: 7 (7-34).">Cumeni</a>, and the city of Antiparah.

<div id="alma/56/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.

<div id="alma/56/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="alma/56/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 56: 10.">sons</a> of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.

<div id="alma/56/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>
<div id="alma/56/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="alma/56/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken.  And thus ended the twenty and sixth year.  And in the *commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>
<div id="alma/56/21" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="22"></a>
<div id="alma/56/22" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;22 
And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="23"></a>
<div id="alma/56/23" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;23 
For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front.  We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="24"></a>
<div id="alma/56/24" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;24 
They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="25"></a>
<div id="alma/56/25" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;25 
Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.

<div class="verse"><a name="26"></a>
<div id="alma/56/26" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;26 
And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.

<div class="verse"><a name="27"></a>
<div id="alma/56/27" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;27 
And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="28"></a>
<div id="alma/56/28" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;28 
And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla.  And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="29"></a>
<div id="alma/56/29" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;29 
And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="30"></a>
<div id="alma/56/30" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;30 
Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/30a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 52: 21; Alma 58: 1.">as</a> if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="31"></a>
<div id="alma/56/31" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;31 
And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="32"></a>
<div id="alma/56/32" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;32 
And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to that city.

<div class="verse"><a name="33"></a>
<div id="alma/56/33" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;33 
And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city.  But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="34"></a>
<div id="alma/56/34" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;34 
And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.

<div id="alma/56/35" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;35 
And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.

<div class="verse"><a name="36"></a>
<div id="alma/56/36" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;36 
And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward.  And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;

<div class="verse"><a name="37"></a>
<div id="alma/56/37" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;37 
Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="38"></a>
<div id="alma/56/38" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;38 
And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army.  But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.

<div class="verse"><a name="39"></a>
<div id="alma/56/39" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;39 
And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us.  Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.

<div class="verse"><a name="40"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;40 
Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.

And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;42 
But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.

And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;

&nbsp;&nbsp;46 
For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/46a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 61: 10 (10-11).">not</a> suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.

&nbsp;&nbsp;47 
Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/56/47a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Birthright; TG Liberty.">liberty</a> of their <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/56/47b" mark="b" type="C" title="Alma 53: 17 (15-18); TG Honoring Father and Mother.">fathers</a> than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/56/47c" mark="c" type="C" title="Alma 57: 21; TG Marriage, Motherhood.">mothers</a>, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.

For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march—therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.
