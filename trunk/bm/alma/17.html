And</span> now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 16: 6.">Manti</a>, behold, to his astonishment, he <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 27: 16.">met</a> with the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/17/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 34.">sons</a> of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.

Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 11 (11-17).">first</a> appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/2b" mark="b" type="C" title="Jacob 7: 23; D&C 84: 85; TG Scriptures, Study of.">searched</a> the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.

And they had been teaching the word of God *for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 29: 14.">success</a> in bringing many to the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Missionary Work.">knowledge</a> of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/17/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="Num. 5: 7 (6-10); Mosiah 26: 29 (29, 35); 3 Ne. 1: 25.">confess</a> their sins before him.

Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 10.">labor</a> in the spirit.

Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 16: 15 (15-32).">provide</a> food for themselves while in the wilderness.

And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/9a" mark="a" type="C" title="Alma 25: 17; TG Guidance, Divine.">prayed</a> much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 10; Alma 26: 3.">instrument</a> in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/17/9c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 3: 11.">traditions</a> of their fathers, which were not correct.

And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.

And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 21: 1.">separated</a> themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/13b" mark="b" type="A" title="Matt. 9: 37.">harvest</a>; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="alma/17/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 10: 12.">wild</a> and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.

Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 3: 19 (6-19); 3 Ne. 2: 15 (15-16).">curse</a> of God had fallen upon them because of the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/17/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 9: 16 (16-24); Alma 18: 5.">traditions</a> of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.

Therefore, this was the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 28: 2 (1-3).">cause</a> for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.

And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/20a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 7 (7-10).">bound</a> him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.

But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/25a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 21: 19.">servant</a> to king Lamoni.

And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/26a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 2: 17 (15-20).">water</a>, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water—

Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/27a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 18: 3 (3-7); Ex. 19: 21 (20-21).">scattered</a> the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.

Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men.  And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.

Now they wept because of the fear of being slain.  Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/17/29a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 5: 8.">believe</a> in my words.

And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.
