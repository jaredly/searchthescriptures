But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/14/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 12: 7 (3-7).">plainness</a> of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/14/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 10: 28 (24-32).">lied</a> unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.

And the people went forth and witnessed against them—testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/14/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 11: 35 (33-37).">not</a> save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek.

And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene?  Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/14/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 8: 31 (30-31).">power</a> of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.

But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/14/11a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Exaltation.">glory</a>; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/14/11b" mark="b" type="C" title="Ex. 23: 7; Ps. 37: 9 (8-13); Alma 60: 13; D&C 103: 3; TG Justice.">judgments</a> which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the <sup>c</sup><a href="alma/14/11c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Cruelty; TG Martyrdom.">blood</a> of the <sup>d</sup><a href="alma/14/11d" mark="d" type="A" title="Lam. 4: 13; Mosiah 17: 10.">innocent</a> shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.

Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their <sup>a</sup><a href="alma/14/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 22: 24 (14-27).">cheeks</a>, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a <sup>b</sup><a href="alma/14/14b" mark="b" type="C" title="Alma 12: 17; TG Damnation.">lake</a> of fire and brimstone?
