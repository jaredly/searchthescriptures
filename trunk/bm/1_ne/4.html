And</span> it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/4/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Courage; TG Dependability; TG Faithful.">faithful</a> in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not <sup>b</sup><a href="1_ne/4/1b" mark="b" type="C" title="1 Ne. 7: 11; TG God, Power of.">mightier</a> than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?

Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.

And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls.  And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.

Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/4/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Drunkenness.">drunken</a> with wine.

And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/4/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 6; Mosiah 2: 22; Ether 2: 7 (7-12).">Inasmuch</a> as thy seed shall keep my <sup>b</sup><a href="1_ne/4/14b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Commandments of God.">commandments</a>, they shall <sup>c</sup><a href="1_ne/4/14c" mark="c" type="A" title="1 Ne. 2: 20.">prosper</a> in the <sup>d</sup><a href="1_ne/4/14d" mark="d" type="A" title="1 Ne. 17: 13 (13-14); Jacob 2: 12.">land</a> of promise.

Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/4/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 17: 51.">sword</a>.

And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban.
