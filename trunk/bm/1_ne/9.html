And</span> all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/9/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 2: 6 (4-6, 8, 14-15); 1 Ne. 16: 6 (6, 12).">valley</a> of Lemuel, and also a great many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.

And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/9/2a" mark="a" type="E" title="IE the full account is on larger plates; the special account of his ministry is on the smaller plates of Nephi; Jacob 3: 13-14; 1 Ne. 1: 17 (16-17); 1 Ne. 6: 1; 1 Ne. 10: 1; 1 Ne. 19: 2, 4; Omni 1: 1; W of M 1: 3 (2-11); D&C 10: 38 (38-40).">plates</a> upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.

Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, for the special <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/9/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 3: 19.">purpose</a> that there should be an account engraven of the <sup>b</sup><a href="1_ne/9/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 6: 3.">ministry</a> of my people.

Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people; wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_ne/9/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 4: 14; 2 Ne. 5: 33 (29-33); Jacob 1: 3 (2-4); Jarom 1: 14; Omni 1: 18; W of M 1: 10.">other</a> plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions of my people.
