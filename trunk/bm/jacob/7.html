Sherem denies Christ, contends with Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten of God—All of the prophets have spoken of Christ and his atonement—The Nephites lived out their days as wanderers, born in tribulation, and hated by  the Lamanites.  Between 544 and 421 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was <sup>a</sup><a href="jacob/7/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG False Prophets.">Sherem</a>.

And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be <sup>a</sup><a href="jacob/7/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 21: 8; Alma 30: 12 (12, 22).">no</a> Christ.  And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might <sup>b</sup><a href="jacob/7/2b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG False Doctrine.">overthrow</a> the doctrine of Christ.

And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.

And he was <sup>a</sup><a href="jacob/7/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Learning.">learned</a>, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much <sup>b</sup><a href="jacob/7/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Flattery.">flattery</a>, and much power of speech, according to the <sup>c</sup><a href="jacob/7/4c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG False Priesthoods.">power</a> of the devil.

And also, I had <sup>c</sup><a href="jacob/7/5c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ex. 19: 9 (9-13).">heard</a> the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.

And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the <sup>a</sup><a href="jacob/7/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 31: 2.">gospel</a>, or the doctrine of Christ.

And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and <sup>a</sup><a href="jacob/7/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jacob 4: 5.">keep</a> not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence.  And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is <sup>b</sup><a href="jacob/7/7b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Blasphemy.">blasphemy</a>; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot <sup>c</sup><a href="jacob/7/7c" mark="c" type="A" title="Alma 30: 13.">tell</a> of things to come.
