And</span> it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.  And I caused that there should be <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Weapon.">weapons</a> of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.

And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.

And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 9.">grain</a> and all manner of fruit of every kind.

And it came to pass that king <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 10 (10-11); Mosiah 24: 3.">Laman</a> died, and his son began to reign in his stead.  And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.

But I had sent my spies out round about the land of <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 11: 12.">Shemlon</a>, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.

And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 5: 14; Jarom 1: 8; Alma 2: 12.">armed</a> with <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/10/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Enos 1: 20; Alma 3: 5 (4-5).">bows</a>, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.

And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.

And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did go up in the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Strength; TG Trust in God.">strength</a> of the Lord to battle.

Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/11a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Trust Not in the Arm of Flesh.">strength</a> of men.

They were a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 14.">wild</a>, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/10/12b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Ne. 5: 1 (1-3); Mosiah 1: 5; Alma 3: 8.">tradition</a> of their fathers, which is this—Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/10/12c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Injustice.">wronged</a> in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;

And his brethren were <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 18: 10 (10-11).">wroth</a> with him because they <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/10/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Ne. 15: 8 (8-11); 2 Ne. 1: 25 (24-27).">understood</a> not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.

And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.

For this very cause has king Laman, by his <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/10/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 10; Mosiah 19: 28 (26, 28).">cunning</a>, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.
