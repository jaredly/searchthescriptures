Amulon persecutes Alma and his people—They are to be put to death if they pray—The Lord makes their burdens seem light—He delivers them from bondage, and they return to Zarahemla.  Between 145 and 120 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 31; Alma 21: 3 (2-4).">land</a> of Amulon.

For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.

And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 10 (10-11); Mosiah 10: 6.">Laman</a>, being called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman.  And he was king over a numerous people.

And he appointed <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 2: 4; Mosiah 18: 18 (18-22); Mosiah 23: 14.">teachers</a> of the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/24/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 9 (9, 12, 31).">brethren</a> of Amulon in every land which was possessed by his people; and thus the <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/24/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="Omni 1: 18.">language</a> of Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.

And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;

And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 34: 10 (10-21); 4 Ne. 1: 46.">trade</a> one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.

And now it came to pass that <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 32.">Amulon</a> began to exercise <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/24/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="D&C 121: 39.">authority</a> over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.

And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/24/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 6: 7 (7-27).">put</a> guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.
