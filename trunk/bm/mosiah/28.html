Now</span> it came to pass that after the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 34.">sons</a> of Mosiah had done all these things, *they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 17: 8.">selected</a>, go up to the land of <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/28/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 1 (1, 3-4, 14); Alma 50: 8 (8, 11).">Nephi</a> that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites—

Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 7: 8; Mosiah 25: 11; Alma 13: 27 (27-30); Alma 31: 2; 3 Ne. 17: 14; Moses 7: 41.">bear</a> that any human <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/3b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Worth of Souls.">soul</a> should <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/28/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="Matt. 18: 14.">perish</a>; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure <sup>d</sup><a href="mosiah/28/3d" mark="d" type="A" title="Jacob 6: 10; Moro. 8: 21; D&C 19: 12 (10-12).">endless</a> torment did cause them to quake and <sup>e</sup><a href="mosiah/28/3e" mark="e" type="A" title="1 Cor. 2: 3.">tremble</a>.

And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 10; Alma 26: 18 (17-18).">vilest</a> of sinners.  And the Lord saw fit in his infinite <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/4b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG God, Mercy of.">mercy</a> to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.

And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.

And king Mosiah went and <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 18: 15; Alma 43: 23.">inquired</a> of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.

And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 35; Alma 19: 23 (22-23).">deliver</a> thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.

And they <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 17: 6 (6-9); Alma 26: 1.">took</a> their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/9b" mark="b" type="D" title="IE in Alma, chapters 17-26.">account</a> of their proceedings hereafter.

Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 29: 3 (1-3).">would</a> accept of the kingdom.

Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 10: 16.">brass</a>, and also the plates of <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="W of M 1: 10.">Nephi</a>, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/28/11c" mark="c" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 27; Alma 37: 21 (21-31).">plates</a> of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;

And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 8.">who</a> had been destroyed.

Now after Mosiah had finished <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/28/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 20; Alma 9: 21.">translating</a> these <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/28/17b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Scriptures, Writing of.">records</a>, behold, it gave an account of the people who were <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/28/17c" mark="c" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 8 (7-12); Alma 22: 30.">destroyed</a>, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the <sup>d</sup><a href="mosiah/28/17d" mark="d" type="A" title="Ether 1: 3 (1-5).">great</a> tower, at the time the Lord <sup>e</sup><a href="mosiah/28/17e" mark="e" type="A" title="Gen. 11: 7 (6-9); Omni 1: 22.">confounded</a> the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.

Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.
