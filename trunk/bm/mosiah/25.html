And</span> now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.

Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 6: 10.">people</a> of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ezek. 17: 22 (22-23); Omni 1: 15 (14-19).">Mulek</a>, and those who came with him into the wilderness.

And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="4"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/4" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together in two bodies.

And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 9: 3 (3-4).">left</a> the land of Zarahemla until they <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 22: 13.">returned</a> again.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="6"></a>

And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/7" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7 
And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement.

<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>

For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 22: 11 (11-13).">out</a> of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="9"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/9" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9 
And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 29 (8, 29).">slain</a> by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 24: 17; Mosiah 27: 16.">bondage</a>, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.

<div class="verse"><a name="11"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/11" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/11a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Pollution.">polluted</a> state, they were filled with <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 28: 3 (3-4); Alma 13: 27.">pain</a> and anguish for the <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/25/11c" mark="c" type="C" title="2 Ne. 6: 3; Jacob 2: 3; TG Worth of Souls.">welfare</a> of their souls.

And it came to pass that those who <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 20: 3 (3-5).">were</a> the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/12b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 23: 33.">daughters</a> of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/25/12c" mark="c" type="A" title="Jacob 1: 14 (13-14); Alma 2: 11.">called</a> Nephites.
</div>

<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
And now all the people of Zarahemla were <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 19.">numbered</a> with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/14" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 35.">baptize</a> them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/18b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 18: 16 (8-17).">waters</a> of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/19a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 26: 17.">churches</a> throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/19b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Priesthood.">ordain</a> <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/25/19c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Priest.">priests</a> and <sup>d</sup><a href="mosiah/25/19d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Teacher.">teachers</a> over every church.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/21" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
Therefore they did <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/21a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Church.">assemble</a> themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="22"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/22" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;22 
And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/22a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 18: 17; Mosiah 26: 4.">church</a>, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="23"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/23" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;23 
And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/23a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Jesus Christ, Taking the Name of.">name</a> of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;

<div class="verse"><a name="24"></a>
<div id="mosiah/25/24" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;24 
And they were called the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/25/24a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Sons and Daughters of God.">people</a> of God.  And the Lord did pour out his <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/25/24b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG God, Spirit of; TG Prosper.">Spirit</a> upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.
