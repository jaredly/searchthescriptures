Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated by the Lamanites—They meet Ammon and are converted—They tell Ammon of the twenty-four Jaredite plates.  Between 145 and 121 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.

And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began again to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they began to come into the borders of the land round about.

Now they durst not slay them, because of the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 25; Mosiah 20: 24.">oath</a> which their king had made unto Limhi; but they would smite them on their <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Lam. 3: 30; Mosiah 12: 2.">cheeks</a>, and exercise authority over them; and began to put heavy <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/21/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ex. 1: 11 (10-11); Mosiah 12: 5; Mosiah 24: 9.">burdens</a> upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb ass—

Yea, all this was done that the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 3: 19.">word</a> of the Lord might be <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 20: 21.">fulfilled</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there was no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands, for the Lamanites had <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 28; Mosiah 22: 6 (6-10).">surrounded</a> them on every side.

<div class="verse"><a name="6"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/6" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the king because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous to go against them to battle.  And they did afflict the king sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires.

<div class="verse"><a name="7"></a>

And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of their land.

<div class="verse"><a name="8"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/8" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and drove them back, and <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 29.">slew</a> many of them.

And now there was a great <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/9a" mark="a" type="C" title="Mosiah 12: 4; TG Mourning.">mourning</a> and lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for their brethren.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10 
Now there were a great many <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Widows.">widows</a> in the land, and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them.

<div class="verse"><a name="11"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/11" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11 
And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven back again, suffering much loss.

Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the city of Nephi.

And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 28 (26, 28); Mosiah 21: 36.">yoke</a> of bondage, <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/13b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Submissiveness.">submitting</a> themselves to be smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the desires of their enemies.

And they did <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 29: 20.">humble</a> themselves even in the depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their God that he would <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/14b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Deliverance; TG Protection, Divine.">deliver</a> them out of their afflictions.

And now the Lord was slow to <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 8: 18; Prov. 15: 29; Isa. 59: 2; Jer. 7: 16; Jer. 14: 12 (10-12); Mosiah 11: 24 (23-25); D&C 101: 7 (7-9).">hear</a> their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ex. 3: 9 (7, 9); 2 Ne. 26: 15; D&C 109: 49.">cries</a>, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.

And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.

<div id="mosiah/21/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17 
Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 4: 26 (16, 26).">impart</a> to the support of the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/17b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Widows.">widows</a> and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.
</div>
</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;18 
Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="19"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/19" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;19 
And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="20"></a>
<div id="mosiah/21/20" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;20 
And he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/20a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 20: 5.">daughters</a> of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come upon them.

<div class="verse"><a name="21"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
For they were desirous to take them that they might <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 7 (7-11).">punish</a> them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait for them.

And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, *even until the time that <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/22a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 6 (6-13).">Ammon</a> and his brethren came into the land.

&nbsp;&nbsp;23 
And the king having been without the gates of the city with his guard, <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/23a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 10.">discovered</a> Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be taken, and bound, and cast into <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/23b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 7 (6-8); Hel. 5: 21.">prison</a>.

But when he found that they were not, but that they were his brethren, and had come from the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/24a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 13.">land</a> of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceedingly great joy.

Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/25a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 7.">small</a> number of men to <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/25b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 14.">search</a> for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;26 
Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/26a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 8; Hel. 3: 6 (3-12).">bones</a>; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/26b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 7: 6 (6-11).">coming</a> of Ammon.

And they brought a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/27a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 8: 9; Mosiah 28: 11.">record</a> with them, even a record of the people whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates of ore.

<div id="mosiah/21/28" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;28 
And now Limhi was again filled with joy on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/28a" mark="a" type="C" title="Omni 1: 20 (20-22); Mosiah 28: 13 (11-19); TG God, Gifts of.">gift</a> from God, whereby he could <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/28b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Cor. 12: 10; Mosiah 8: 6 (6, 12-13).">interpret</a> such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.

<div class="verse"><a name="29"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;29 
Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so many of their brethren had been <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/29a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 8 (7-14); Mosiah 25: 9.">slain</a>;

&nbsp;&nbsp;30 
And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/30a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 17: 13 (12-20).">death</a> of Abinadi; and also for the <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/21/30b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 18: 34 (34-35).">departure</a> of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.

&nbsp;&nbsp;31 
Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled.  Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/31a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 18: 13.">covenant</a> with God to serve him and keep his commandments.

Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/34a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 18: 17.">church</a>, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.  Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.

They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/21/35a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 25: 18 (17-18).">given</a> hereafter.
