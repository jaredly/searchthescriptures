Now</span> there was a place in <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 6.">Shemlon</a> where the daughters of the Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/20/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Judg. 21: 21.">dance</a>, and to make themselves merry.

And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of them gathered together to sing and to dance.

And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 21.">slay</a> them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and their <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/20/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 25: 12.">children</a>.

And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;

And when there were but few of them gathered together to dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them and carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 21: 20; Mosiah 23: 33 (30-35).">daughters</a> of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.

And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.

Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.

And now Limhi had discovered them from the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 11: 12.">tower</a>, even all their preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in the forests.

And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting places, and began to slay them.

And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their prey.

And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites.  But they <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Alma 43: 45.">fought</a> for their lives, and for their <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/20/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 46: 12.">wives</a>, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.

And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.

And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.

But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him.  And they brought him.  And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people?  Behold, my people have not broken the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 26 (25-26).">oath</a> that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?

&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.

And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish.  Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.

And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold also there are but few of us.

And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/20/22a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 19: 26.">oath</a> which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/20/22b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Life, Sanctity of.">lives</a>; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.

And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.
