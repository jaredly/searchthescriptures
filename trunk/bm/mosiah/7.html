And</span> now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who <sup>a</sup><a href="mosiah/7/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Omni 1: 27 (27-30).">went</a> up to dwell in the land of <sup>b</sup><a href="mosiah/7/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Ne. 5: 8; Mosiah 9: 6.">Lehi</a>-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of <sup>c</sup><a href="mosiah/7/1c" mark="c" type="A" title="Omni 1: 13.">Zarahemla</a>; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.
