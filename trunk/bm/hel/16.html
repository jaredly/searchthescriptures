<div class="summary">
The Nephites who believe Samuel are baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be slain with their arrows and stones—Some harden their hearts, and others see angels—The unbelievers say it is not reasonable to believe in Christ and his coming in Jerusalem.  Between 5 and 1 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 13: 4.">walls</a> of the city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/16/1b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 9: 27.">baptized</a> unto the Lord.

But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Prov. 29: 10.">angry</a> with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.

Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.

For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/4a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Miracle.">miracles</a> among the people, that they might know that the Christ must <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/16/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Hel. 14: 2.">shortly</a> come—

Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.

But the <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 15: 5; 3 Ne. 1: 22.">more</a> part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/16/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Hel. 13: 24.">Take</a> this fellow and bind him, for behold he <sup>c</sup><a href="hel/16/6c" mark="c" type="A" title="John 7: 20.">hath</a> a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.

And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 13: 2.">among</a> his own people.

And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/12a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Disobedience.">contrary</a> to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.

Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the Nephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/16/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Isa. 5: 21.">own</a> strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:
