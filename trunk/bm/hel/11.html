Nephi persuades the Lord to replace their war with a famine—Many people perish—They repent, and Nephi importunes the Lord for rain—Nephi and Lehi receive many revelations—The Gadianton robbers entrench themselves in the land.  Between 20 and 7 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>

And</span> now it came to pass in the *seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.

And it was this <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 6: 22 (18-24); Hel. 11: 26 (25-26).">secret</a> band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all that year; and in the *seventy and third year it did also last.

And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:

O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 11: 14.">let</a> there be a <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/11/4b" mark="b" type="C" title="1 Kgs. 8: 35; 1 Chr. 21: 12; Hel. 10: 6; TG Famine.">famine</a> in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;5 
And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.  And thus in the *seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.

And this work of destruction did also continue in the *seventy and fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/6a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Drought.">dry</a>, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.

And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Amos 4: 7 (6-10); Hel. 12: 3.">remember</a> the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.

And the people <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ex. 10: 7.">began</a> to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our <sup>b</sup><a href="hel/11/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Hel. 10: 11 (11-14).">destruction</a> be fulfilled.

And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired.

And it came to pass that in the *seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/17a" mark="a" type="A" title="Deut. 11: 14 (13-17); Ether 2: 24; D&C 117: 1.">rain</a> should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit.

And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 10: 7 (5-11).">great</a> prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.

And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/20a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jarom 1: 6; Alma 22: 27 (27, 32-33); Hel. 3: 8; 3 Ne. 1: 17.">cover</a> the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.

And in the *seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife.

And it came to pass that in the *eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a <sup>a</sup><a href="hel/11/24a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 4: 3.">war</a> with their brethren.

<div class="verse"><a name="25"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;25 
And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.
