And</span> now behold, there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites who did <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/5/1a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Doubt.">doubt</a> in the least the words of all the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled.

And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken.

And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not slain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would repent of their sins and <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/5/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 6: 3.">enter</a> into a <sup>b</sup><a href="3_ne/5/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 44: 15; Alma 62: 16 (16-17).">covenant</a> that they would murder no more were set at <sup>c</sup><a href="3_ne/5/4c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Liberty.">liberty</a>.

But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those <sup>a</sup><a href="3_ne/5/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Ne. 10: 15.">secret</a> murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.
