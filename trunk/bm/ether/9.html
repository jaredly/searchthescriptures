And</span> now I, Moroni, proceed with my record.  Therefore, behold, it came to pass that because of the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 8: 15 (13-17).">secret</a> combinations of Akish and his friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer.

And the Lord <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Dream; TG Warnings.">warned</a> Omer in a dream that he should depart out of the land; wherefore Omer <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/9/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Ether 9: 13.">departed</a> out of the land with his family, and traveled many days, and came over and passed by the hill of <sup>c</sup><a href="ether/9/3c" mark="c" type="A" title="Morm. 1: 3; Morm. 4: 23.">Shim</a>, and came over by the place <sup>d</sup><a href="ether/9/3d" mark="d" type="A" title="Morm. 6: 2 (1-15).">where</a> the Nephites were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which was called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared and his family.

And it came to pass that Akish <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Esth. 2: 21.">sought</a> the life of his father-in-law; and he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/9/5b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Oath.">oath</a> of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people.

For so great had been the spreading of this wicked and secret society that it had corrupted the hearts of all the people; therefore Jared was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned in his stead.

And it came to pass that Akish began to be <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Jealousy.">jealous</a> of his son, therefore he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or no food until he had suffered death.

Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish was desirous for <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/11a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Tyranny.">power</a>; wherefore, the sons of Akish did offer them <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/9/11b" mark="b" type="C" title="1 Sam. 8: 3 (1-4); Hel. 9: 20; TG Bribery.">money</a>, by which means they drew away the more part of the people after them.

And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/9/20a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 2: 15.">choice</a> above all other lands; and he commanded that whoso should possess the land should possess it unto the Lord, or they should be <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/9/20b" mark="b" type="A" title="Deut. 31: 4 (4-5); Ether 2: 8 (8-11).">destroyed</a> when they were ripened in iniquity; for upon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath.
