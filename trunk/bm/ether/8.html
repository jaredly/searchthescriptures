And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of Heth.  And it came to pass that he did <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/8/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 1: 7; Hel. 2: 5.">flatter</a> many people, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the kingdom.

And now, in the days of the reign of Omer he was in <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/8/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 7: 7 (5-7); Ether 10: 14.">captivity</a> the half of his days.  And it came to pass that he begat sons and daughters, among whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;

And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared they were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that they would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto his father.  And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his life.

And now Jared became exceedingly <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/8/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 2: 13.">sorrowful</a> because of the loss of the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and upon the glory of the world.

And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/8/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mark 6: 24 (22-28).">head</a> of my father, the king.

And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she pleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife.  And it came to pass that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to wife.
