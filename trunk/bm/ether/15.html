And</span> it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds, he began to remember the <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/15/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 13: 20 (20-21).">words</a> which Ether had spoken unto him.

He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/15/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ether 1: 43.">two</a> millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.

He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his soul <sup>a</sup><a href="ether/15/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Mourning.">mourned</a> and refused to be <sup>b</sup><a href="ether/15/3b" mark="b" type="C" title="Gen. 37: 35; Moses 7: 44; TG Comfort.">comforted</a>.

And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.

And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum, which, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents near unto them; and therefore on the morrow they did come to battle.
