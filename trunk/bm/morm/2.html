And</span> it came to pass in that same year there began to be a war again between the Nephites and the Lamanites.  And notwithstanding I being <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 1: 15 (12, 15-16).">young</a>, was large in stature; therefore the people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader, or the leader of their armies.

Therefore it came to pass that *in my sixteenth year I did go forth at the head of an army of the Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had passed away.

And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh year the Lamanites did come upon us with <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 4: 13 (13-17); Morm. 5: 6.">exceedingly</a> great power, insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore they would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/2/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Alma 50: 11; Morm. 2: 29.">north</a> countries.

And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola, and we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend ourselves against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 3: 14 (14, 25); Morm. 2: 21.">fortify</a> the city with our might; but notwithstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive us out of the city.

And it came to pass that we did gather in our people as fast as it were possible, that we might get them together in <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 3: 22 (22-25).">one</a> body.

And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Moro. 9: 17.">Aaron</a>; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand.

And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Hel. 12: 18; Hel. 13: 18 (17-23); Morm. 1: 18 (17-19); Ether 14: 1 (1-2).">keep</a> that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.

Thus there began to be a <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="3 Ne. 12: 4.">mourning</a> and a lamentation in all the land because of these things, and more especially among the people of Nephi.

But behold this my joy was vain, for their <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/2/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Cor. 7: 10; Alma 42: 29.">sorrowing</a> was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the <sup>b</sup><a href="morm/2/13b" mark="b" type="A" title="Hosea 7: 14; Ether 8: 7.">sorrowing</a> of the <sup>c</sup><a href="morm/2/13c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Damnation.">damned</a>, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take <sup>d</sup><a href="morm/2/13d" mark="d" type="A" title="Alma 41: 10.">happiness</a> in sin.
