And</span> it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did repent of the <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/5/1a" mark="a" type="C" title="Morm. 3: 11 (11, 16); TG Vows.">oath</a> which I had made that I would no more assist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.

But behold, I was <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/5/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 3: 12.">without</a> hope, for I knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that Being who created them.

And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did maintain the city.  And there were also other cities which were maintained by the Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that they could not get into the country which lay before us, to destroy the inhabitants of our land.

And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so <sup>a</sup><a href="morm/5/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 2: 3; Morm. 4: 13 (13-17).">great</a> were their numbers that they did tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.
