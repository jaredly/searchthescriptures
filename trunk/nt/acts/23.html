And the high priest <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Acts 24: 1.">Ananias</a> commanded them that stood by him to <sup>b</sup><a href="acts/23/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="John 18: 22 (20-23).">smite</a> him on the mouth.

Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <i>thou</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ps. 5: 9 (9-10); Matt. 23: 27; Luke 11: 44.">whited</a> wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?

Then said Paul, I <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR knew.">wist</a> not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the <sup>b</sup><a href="acts/23/5b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Citizenship.">ruler</a> of thy people.

But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Acts 26: 5; Philip. 3: 5.">Pharisee</a>, the son of a Pharisee: of the <sup>b</sup><a href="acts/23/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Acts 28: 20.">hope</a> and <sup>c</sup><a href="acts/23/6c" mark="c" type="A" title="Acts 24: 21.">resurrection</a> of the dead I am called in question.

And there arose a great cry: and the <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Scribes.">scribes</a> <i>that were</i> of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an <sup>b</sup><a href="acts/23/9b" mark="b" type="A" title="Acts 22: 8 (6-10).">angel</a> hath spoken to him, let us not <sup>c</sup><a href="acts/23/9c" mark="c" type="A" title="Acts 5: 39 (34-40).">fight</a> against God.

Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, <sup>a</sup><a href="acts/23/15a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR before he gets here.">or</a> ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
