Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion.  It commenced with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country.  Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected by it, and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small stir and division amongst the people, some crying, “<sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 24: 23.">Lo</a>, here!” and others, “Lo, there!”  Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist.

For, notwithstanding the great <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Pet. 1: 22.">love</a> which the converts to these different faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the great zeal manifested by the respective clergy, who were active in getting up and promoting this extraordinary scene of religious feeling, in order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off, some to one party and some to another, it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/6b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Guile; TG Hypocrisy.">pretended</a> than real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued—priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions.

I was at this time in my fifteenth year.  My father’s family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother, Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.

During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit.  In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion and <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/8a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Strife.">strife</a> among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="D&C 101: 95 (93-95).">right</a> and who was wrong.

My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant.  The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error.  On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.

In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done?  Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together?  If any one of them be <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/10a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Truth.">right</a>, which is it, and how shall I know it?

While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="James 1: 5 (1-7).">James</a>, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: <i>If any of you lack <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/11b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 3: 12; 2 Ne. 28: 15; Jacob 6: 12.">wisdom</a>, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</i>

Never did any passage of <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/12a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 138: 6.">scripture</a> come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine.  It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart.  I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/12b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Guidance, Divine.">wisdom</a> from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/12c" mark="c" type="A" title="1 Cor. 2: 11 (10-16).">understood</a> the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.

At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Micah 7: 8.">darkness</a> and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.  I at length came to the determination to “ask of God,” concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/13b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Communication.">give</a> liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.

So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 14: 23.">woods</a> to make the attempt.  It was on the morning of a <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/14b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Beauty.">beautiful</a>, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.  It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/14c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Prayer.">pray</a> <sup>d</sup><a href="js_h/1/14d" mark="d" type="A" title="Ps. 77: 1.">vocally</a>.

After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God.  I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Eph. 6: 12 (11-18).">seized</a> upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.  Thick <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/15b" mark="b" type="C" title="Gen. 15: 12 (1-21); TG Darkness, Physical.">darkness</a> gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.

Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had.  I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 3: 1.">visions</a> or <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/21b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Revelation.">revelations</a> in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.

However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/24a" mark="a" type="C" title="Ezek. 1: 1; 1 Ne. 1: 16; TG Vision.">vision</a>.

I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty-first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued to <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/27a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Cor. 1: 12.">affirm</a> that I had seen a vision.

During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three—having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted by those who ought to have been my <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/28a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Friendship.">friends</a> and to have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affectionate manner to have reclaimed me—I was left to all kinds of <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/28b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Temptation.">temptations</a>; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/28c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ps. 25: 7; D&C 20: 5.">errors</a>, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God.  In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins.  A disposition to commit such was never in my nature.  But I was guilty of <sup>d</sup><a href="js_h/1/28d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Levity.">levity</a>, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was <sup>e</sup><a href="js_h/1/28e" mark="e" type="B" title="TG Called of God.">called</a> of God as I had been.  But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth, and is acquainted with my native <sup>f</sup><a href="js_h/1/28f" mark="f" type="B" title="TG Cheerfulness.">cheery</a> temperament.

In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/29a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Prayer.">prayer</a> and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/29b" mark="b" type="A" title="James 1: 6 (5-7).">confidence</a> in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.

While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/30a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 1: 6.">light</a> appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/30b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Angels.">personage</a> appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.

It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant.  His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles.  His head and neck were also bare.  I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.

After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament.  He first quoted part of the third chapter of <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/36a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mal. 3; Mal. 4.">Malachi</a>; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles.  Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus:

He also quoted the next verse differently: <i>And he shall plant in the hearts of the <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/39a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Genealogy and Temple Work; TG Salvation for the Dead.">children</a> the <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/39b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gal. 3: 5, 8, 18, 29.">promises</a> made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.

In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/40a" mark="a" type="A" title="Isa. 11: 10 (1-16).">Isaiah</a>, saying that it was about to be fulfilled.  He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament.  He said that that <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/40b" mark="b" type="A" title="Deut. 18: 15 (15-19); Acts 3: 22 (22-23); Acts 7: 37.">prophet</a> was Christ; but the day had not yet come when “they who would not hear his voice should be <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/40c" mark="c" type="A" title="3 Ne. 20: 23; 3 Ne. 21: 20.">cut</a> off from among the people,” but soon would come.

He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be.  And he further stated that the fulness of the <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/41b" mark="b" type="C" title="Isa. 42: 6; Rom. 11: 25 (11-27); D&C 88: 84 (84-85); TG Gentiles.">Gentiles</a> was soon to come in.

Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/42a" mark="a" type="A" title="JS-H 1: 59.">destroyed</a>.

After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/43a" mark="a" type="A" title="Acts 1: 9.">ascended</a> till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.

I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the midst of my <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/44a" mark="a" type="C" title="D&C 76: 19; TG Meditation.">meditation</a>, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside.

He commenced, and <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/45a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ezek. 2: 3 (1-10); Ezek. 3: 4 (1-27).">again</a> related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/45b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Judgment.">judgments</a> which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/45c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Famine.">famine</a>, <sup>d</sup><a href="js_h/1/45d" mark="d" type="A" title="Deut. 32: 25; 1 Ne. 1: 13; Alma 10: 22.">sword</a>, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation.

By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/46a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 8: 27.">astonishment</a> at what I had both seen and heard.  But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/46b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Temptation.">tempt</a> me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father’s family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/46c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Sacrilege.">rich</a>.  This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other <sup>d</sup><a href="js_h/1/46d" mark="d" type="A" title="Luke 11: 34 (34-36); D&C 121: 37.">motive</a> than that of building his kingdom; otherwise I could not get them.

My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home.  I started with the intention of going to the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed me, and I <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/48b" mark="b" type="A" title="Acts 9: 4 (4-8).">fell</a> helpless on the ground, and for a time was quite unconscious of anything.

The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name.  I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my head, surrounded by light as before.

On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box.

In the month of October, 1825, I hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, State of New York.  He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the mine.  After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands, to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month, without success in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it.  Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money-digger.

Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/58a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Hate; TG Persecution.">persecution</a> still followed me, and my wife’s father’s family were very much opposed to our being married.  I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York.  Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and went to my father’s, and <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/58b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Industry.">farmed</a> with him that season.

At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate.  On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/59a" mark="a" type="A" title="Isa. 29: 12.">me</a> with this charge: that I should be <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/59b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Dependability; TG Trustworthiness.">responsible</a> for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any <sup>c</sup><a href="js_h/1/59c" mark="c" type="A" title="JS-H 1: 42.">neglect</a> of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to <sup>d</sup><a href="js_h/1/59d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Scriptures, Preservation of.">preserve</a> them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.

I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them.  For no sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/60a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Stealing.">get</a> them from me.  Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose.  The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible.  But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand.  When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/60b" mark="b" type="A" title="JS-H 1: 2.">day</a>, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight.

The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/61a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Injustice.">falsehoods</a> about my father’s family, and about myself.  If I were to relate a thousandth part of them, it would fill up volumes.  The persecution, however, became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my wife to Susquehanna county, in the State of Pennsylvania.  While preparing to start—being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise—in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/61b" mark="b" type="A" title="D&C 5: 1 (1-32).">Martin</a> Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey.  Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county, in the State of New York, and a farmer of respectability.

By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates.  I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/62a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Urim and Thummim.">Urim</a> and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife’s father, in the month of December, and the February following.

Sometime in this month of February, the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris came to our place, got the characters which I had drawn off the plates, and started with them to the city of New York.  For what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return, which was as follows:

“I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments.  Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian.  I then showed him those which were not yet translated, and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters.  He gave me a certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters, and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct.  I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them.  I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him.

“He then said to me, ‘Let me see that certificate.’ I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/65a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Angels, Ministering.">angels</a>, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them.  I informed him that part of the plates were <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/65b" mark="b" type="A" title="Isa. 29: 11 (11-12); Dan. 12: 9; 1 Ne. 14: 26; 2 Ne. 27: 10; Ether 4: 5 (4-7); D&C 35: 18.">sealed</a>, and that I was forbidden to bring them.  He replied, ‘I cannot read a sealed book.’ I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.”

We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting <sup>a</sup><a href="js_h/1/68a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Baptism; TG Baptism, Essential; TG Baptism, Immersion.">baptism</a> for the <sup>b</sup><a href="js_h/1/68b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Remission of Sins.">remission</a> of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates.
