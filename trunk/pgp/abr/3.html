And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its <sup>a</sup><a href="abr/3/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 2: 21.">times</a> and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a <sup>b</sup><a href="abr/3/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Abr. 5: 13.">day</a> unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand <sup>c</sup><a href="abr/3/4c" mark="c" type="A" title="Ps. 90: 4; 2 Pet. 3: 8.">years</a> according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest.  This is the reckoning of the Lord’s <sup>d</sup><a href="abr/3/4d" mark="d" type="B" title="TG Time.">time</a>, according to the reckoning of Kolob.

And the Lord said unto me: The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule the day, even the night, is above or <sup>a</sup><a href="abr/3/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE It rotates on its axis more slowly. See also v. 7.">greater</a> than that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning, for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of days, and of months, and of years.

And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these <sup>a</sup><a href="abr/3/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="Abr. 3: 16 (16-19).">two</a> facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth upon which thou standest, and the set time of the greater light which is set to rule the day, and the set time of the lesser light which is set to rule the night.

Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the time of the earth upon which thou standest.
