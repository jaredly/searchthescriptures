And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that <i>was</i> in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/1/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 12: 24.">Baal</a>-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.

And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, <i>Is it</i> not because <i>there is</i> not a God in Israel, <i>that</i> thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?  therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
