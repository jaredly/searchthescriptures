Then</span> Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>; Thus saith the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, To morrow about this time <i>shall</i> a measure of fine flour <i>be sold</i> for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

Then a <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/7/2a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR officer, aide.">lord</a> on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, <i>if</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> would make <sup>b</sup><a href="2_kgs/7/2b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mal. 3: 10.">windows</a> in heaven, might this thing be?

If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine <i>is</i> in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.  Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.

And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, <i>there was</i> no man there.

For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_kgs/7/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 6: 17.">chariots</a>, and a noise of horses, <i>even</i> the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid <i>it;</i> and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence <i>also, </i>and went and hid <i>it.</i>

Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day <i>is</i> a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household.

So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, <i>there was</i> no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they <i>were.</i>

&#182; And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us.  They know that we <i>be</i> hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

And one of his servants answered and said, Let <i>some</i> take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they <i>are</i> as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, <i>I say,</i> they <i>are</i> even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
