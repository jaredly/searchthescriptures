And</span> David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done?  what <i>is</i> mine iniquity?  and what <i>is</i> my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me?  it <i>is</i> not <i>so.</i>

And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly <i>as</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth, and <i>as</i> thy soul liveth, <i>there is</i> but a step between me and death.

Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 18: 1; D&C 88: 123.">desireth</a>, I will even do <i>it</i> for thee.

And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow <i>is</i> the new <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/5a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Astronomy.">moon</a>, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third <i>day</i> at even.

If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked <i>leave</i> of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for <i>there is</i> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

If he say thus, <i>It is</i> well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, <i>then</i> be sure that evil is determined by him.

Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 21: 7.">covenant</a> of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="9"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/9" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="10"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/10" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me?  or what <i>if</i> thy father answer thee roughly?

&#182; And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field.  And they went out both of them into the field.

<div id="1_sam/20/12" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Jonathan said unto David, O <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <i>or</i> the third <i>day,</i> and, behold, <i>if there be</i> good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

<div class="verse"><a name="13"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/13" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13 
The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father <i>to do</i> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> be with thee, as he hath been with my father.

<div class="verse"><a name="14"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;14 
And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 9: 1.">kindness</a> of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, that I die not:

<div class="verse"><a name="15"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/15" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15 
But <i>also</i> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="16"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/16" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 
So Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with the house of David, <i>saying,</i> Let the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> even require <i>it</i> at the hand of David’s enemies.

<div class="verse"><a name="17"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/17" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

<div class="verse"><a name="18"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/18" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow <i>is</i> the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;21 
And, behold, I will send a lad, <i>saying, </i>Go, find out the arrows.  If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows <i>are</i> on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for <i>there is</i> peace to thee, and no hurt; <i>as</i> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> liveth.

<div class="verse"><a name="22"></a>

&#182; So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

<div class="verse"><a name="25"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/25" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;25 
And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, <i>even</i> upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.

<div class="verse"><a name="26"></a>

Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he <i>is</i> not clean; surely he <i>is</i> not clean.

<div id="1_sam/20/27" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;27 
And it came to pass on the morrow, <i>which was</i> the second <i>day</i> of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

</div>
<div class="verse"><a name="28"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/28" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked <i>leave </i>of me <i>to go</i> to Beth-lehem:

And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <i>to be there:</i> and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.  Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;30 
Then Saul’s <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/30a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Anger.">anger</a> was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious <i>woman,</i> do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?

<div class="verse"><a name="31"></a>

For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/20/31a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Sam. 23: 17.">established</a>, nor thy kingdom.  Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain?  what hath he done?

<div class="verse"><a name="33"></a>
<div id="1_sam/20/33" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

<div id="1_sam/20/34" onclick='return toggleMarked(event, this)'>

So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
