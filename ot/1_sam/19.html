But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret <i>place,</i> and hide thyself:

&#182; And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works <i>have been </i>to thee-ward very good:

For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest <i>it,</i> and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.
