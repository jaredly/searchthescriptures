And</span> it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.  And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

&#182; Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.

&#182; Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a <sup>a</sup><a href="1_sam/28/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Spirits, Evil or Unclean; TG Superstitions.">familiar</a> spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her.
