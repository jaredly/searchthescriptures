And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward <i>was</i> there, whose name <i>was</i> Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou <sup>a</sup><a href="jer/37/13a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR art deserting.">fallest</a> away to the Chaldeans.

Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of <sup>a</sup><a href="jer/37/21a" mark="a" type="A" title="Jer. 38: 9.">bread</a> out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city were spent.
