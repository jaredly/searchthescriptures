The</span> word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and <sup>a</sup><a href="jer/40/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Matt. 2: 18.">Judah</a>, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.

Now the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> hath brought <i>it,</i> and done according as he hath said: because ye have <sup>a</sup><a href="jer/40/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 101: 2 (1-9).">sinned</a> against the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this <sup>b</sup><a href="jer/40/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Jer. 44: 23.">thing</a> is come upon you.

And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which <i>were</i> upon thine hand.  If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land <i>is</i> before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

&#182; Now when all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> in the fields, <i>even</i> they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the <sup>a</sup><a href="jer/40/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Kgs. 25: 12.">poor</a> of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;

Likewise when all the Jews that <i>were</i> in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that <i>were</i> in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;

Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know <i>it:</i> wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
