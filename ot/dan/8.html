In</span> the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, <i>even unto</i> me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.

And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <i>was</i> at Shushan <i>in</i> the palace, which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/2a" mark="a" type="Q" title="HEB water-course; Dan. 8: 16; 1 Ne. 11: 1 (1-5).">river</a> of Ulai.

Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/3a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 8: 20.">ram</a> which had <i>two</i> horns: and the <i>two</i> horns <i>were</i> high; but one <i>was</i> higher than the other, and the higher came up last.

I saw the ram <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 11: 40.">pushing</a> westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <i>was there any</i> that could deliver out of his hand; but he <sup>b</sup><a href="dan/8/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Dan. 11: 3.">did</a> according to his will, and became great.

And as I was considering, behold, an he <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 8: 21.">goat</a> came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <i>had</i> a notable horn between his eyes.

And he came to the ram that had <i>two</i> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.

And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/7a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB enraged.">moved</a> with <sup>b</sup><a href="dan/8/7b" mark="b" type="A" title="Dan. 11: 11.">choler</a> against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/8a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB instead of it.">for</a> it came up <sup>b</sup><a href="dan/8/8b" mark="b" type="A" title="Dan. 7: 6; Dan. 11: 4 (3-4).">four</a> notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

And out of one of them came forth a little <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/9a" mark="a" type="A" title="Dan. 7: 8.">horn</a>, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i>land.</i>

&#182; Then I heard one <sup>a</sup><a href="dan/8/13a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Saints.">saint</a> speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <i>saint</i> which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i> the daily <i>sacrifice,</i> and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?

&#182; And it came to pass, when I, <i>even</i> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
