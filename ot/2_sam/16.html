And</span> when David was a little past the top <i>of the hill,</i> behold, <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/16/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 9: 2 (2-12).">Ziba</a> the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these?  And Ziba said, The asses <i>be</i> for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

&#182; And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name <i>was</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/16/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 19: 16 (16, 19); 1 Kgs. 2: 8 (8-9).">Shimei</a>, the son of Gera: he came forth, and <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/16/5b" mark="b" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 2: 44.">cursed</a> still as he came.
