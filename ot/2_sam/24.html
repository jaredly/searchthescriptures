And Joab said unto the king, Now the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see <i>it:</i> but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?

&#182; And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.  And David said unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

For when David was up in the morning, the word of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> came unto the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/24/11a" mark="a" type="A" title="Amos 3: 7.">prophet</a> Gad, David’s <sup>b</sup><a href="2_sam/24/11b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Seer.">seer</a>, saying,

So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/24/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 21: 12.">famine</a> come unto thee in thy land?  or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?  or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land?  now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.

And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>; for his <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/24/14a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG God, Mercy of.">mercies</a> <i>are</i> great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.

&#182; So the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.

And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.

And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>, that the plague may be stayed from the people.

And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what <i>seemeth</i> good unto him: behold, <i>here be</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and <i>other</i> instruments of the oxen for wood.

All these <i>things</i> did Araunah, <i>as</i> a king, give unto the king.  And Araunah said unto the king, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> thy God accept thee.

And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy <i>it</i> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> my God of that which doth cost me nothing.  So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/24/24a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 21: 25.">fifty</a> shekels of silver.
