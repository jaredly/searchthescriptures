For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they <i>be</i> mighty men, and they <i>be</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/17/8a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB bitter in their soul.">chafed</a> in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father <i>is</i> a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite <i>is</i> better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
