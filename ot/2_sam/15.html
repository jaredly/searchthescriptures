And <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/15/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 12: 11.">Absalom</a> rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so,</i> that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou?  And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.

Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!

And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so <sup>a</sup><a href="2_sam/15/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Chr. 3: 2.">Absalom</a> stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
