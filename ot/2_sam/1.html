It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <i>so</i> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

And David said unto him, How went the matter?  I pray thee, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
