And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these <i>were </i>the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/21/3a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR fortified.">fenced</a> cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he <i>was</i> the firstborn.

And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/21/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Kgs. 16: 30 (30-33); 2 Chr. 22: 3.">Ahab</a>: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought <i>that which was</i> evil in the eyes of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>.

Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/21/9a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR surrounded.">compassed</a> him in, and the captains of the chariots.

But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, <i>which were</i> better than thyself:

&#182; Moreover the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/21/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Chr. 22: 1.">Arabians</a>, that <i>were</i> near the Ethiopians:

And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/21/17a" mark="a" type="E" title="OR Ahaziah; 2 Chr. 22: 1.">Jehoahaz</a>, the youngest of his sons.

And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.
