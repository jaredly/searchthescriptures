And</span> Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> God of Israel.

For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/30/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Num. 9: 11 (10-11).">second</a> month.

For they could not keep it at <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/30/3a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE in the first month, as required.">that</a> time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done <i>it</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/30/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR in such great numbers.">of</a> a long <i>time in such sort</i> as it was written.

So the <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/30/6a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE couriers, runners (also v. 10).">posts</a> went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, <sup>b</sup><a href="2_chr/30/6b" mark="b" type="A" title="Isa. 10: 21 (21-23); Joel 2: 12 (12-13).">turn</a> again unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and <sup>a</sup><a href="2_chr/30/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Luke 8: 53; Alma 26: 23.">mocked</a> them.
