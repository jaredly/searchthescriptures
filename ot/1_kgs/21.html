And</span> it came to pass after these things, <i>that</i> Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which <i>was</i> in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <i>is</i> near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; <i>or,</i> if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.

And Naboth said to Ahab, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> forbid it me, that I should give the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_kgs/21/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Inheritance.">inheritance</a> of my fathers unto thee.

And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.  And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.

And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee <i>another</i> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed <i>them</i> with his <sup>a</sup><a href="1_kgs/21/8a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Seals.">seal</a>, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that <i>were</i> in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, <i>even</i> against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.
