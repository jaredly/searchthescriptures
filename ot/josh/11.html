And</span> it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard <i>those things,</i> that he sent to Jobab <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/11/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 12: 19 (19-20).">king</a> of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

And to the kings that <i>were</i> on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/11/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 12: 23.">Dor</a> on the west,

&#182; And the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/11/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 17: 32 (32-38); D&C 105: 14.">deliver</a> them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt <sup>b</sup><a href="josh/11/6b" mark="b" type="D" title="OR hock, cut the hamstring of.">hough</a> their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

And the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
