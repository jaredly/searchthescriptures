And</span> the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:

And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/8/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Morm. 7: 4; D&C 98: 33.">Jericho</a> and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.

&#182; And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw <i>it,</i> that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/8/14a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR knew.">wist</a> not that <i>there were</i> liers in ambush against him behind the city.
