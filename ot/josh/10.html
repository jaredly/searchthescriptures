Now</span> it came to pass, when <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/10/1a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB Lord of righteousness.">Adoni</a>-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;

That they feared greatly, because <sup>a</sup><a href="josh/10/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 9: 3.">Gibeon</a> <i>was</i> a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai, and all the men thereof <i>were</i> mighty.

Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
