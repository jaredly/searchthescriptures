And</span> Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name <i>was</i> <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/1a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB In him is strength, swiftness, quickness.">Boaz</a>.

And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/2a" mark="a" type="A" title="Lev. 19: 9; Deut. 24: 19.">glean</a> ears of <sup>b</sup><a href="ruth/2/2b" mark="b" type="D" title="OR grain.">corn</a> after <i>him</i> in whose sight I shall find grace.

And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/3a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR chance, good fortune.">hap</a> was to light on a part of the field <i>belonging</i> unto Boaz, who <i>was</i> of the kindred of Elimelech.

&#182; And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> <i>be</i> with you.  And they answered him, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> bless thee.

And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.

Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter?  Go not to <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="Lev. 19: 9.">glean</a> in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here <sup>b</sup><a href="ruth/2/8b" mark="b" type="D" title="OR close.">fast</a> by my maidens:

<i>Let</i> thine eyes <i>be</i> on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?  and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of <i>that</i> which the young men have drawn.

Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/10a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR notice.">knowledge</a> of me, seeing I <i>am</i> a stranger?

And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and <i>how</i> thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.

Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/13a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Friendship.">friendly</a> unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.  And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched <sup>a</sup><a href="ruth/2/14a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR grain."><i>corn</i></a>, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and <sup>b</sup><a href="ruth/2/14b" mark="b" type="D" title="IE left some food.">left</a>.

And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
