Many Jews are in bondage to their brethren—At Nehemiah’s direction they are freed, their lands are restored, and taking of usury is discontinued.

Yet now our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and <i>some</i> of our daughters are brought unto bondage <i>already: </i>neither <i>is it</i> in our power <i>to redeem them; </i>for other men have our lands and vineyards.

Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/5/7a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Usury.">usury</a>, every one of his brother.  And I set a great assembly against them.

And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren?  or shall they be sold unto us?  Then held they their peace, and found nothing <i>to answer.</i>

Also I said, It <i>is</i> not good that ye do: ought ye not to <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/5/9a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Walking with God.">walk</a> in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the <sup>b</sup><a href="neh/5/9b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Heathen.">heathen</a> our enemies?

I likewise, <i>and</i> my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/5/11a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR the hundred pieces of silver.">the</a> hundredth <i>part</i> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.

Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.  And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>.  And the people did according to this promise.

&#182; Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that is,</i> twelve years, I and my brethren <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/5/14a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 27: 5.">have</a> not eaten the <sup>b</sup><a href="neh/5/14b" mark="b" type="A" title="Mosiah 2: 14 (12, 14).">bread</a> of the governor.

But the former governors that <i>had been</i> before me <sup>a</sup><a href="neh/5/15a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB laid a heavy burden upon the people.">were</a> chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare <sup>b</sup><a href="neh/5/15b" mark="b" type="B" title="TG Authority.">rule</a> over the people: but so did not I, because of the <sup>c</sup><a href="neh/5/15c" mark="c" type="B" title="TG Reverence.">fear</a> of God.

Now <i>that</i> which was prepared <i>for me</i> daily <i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
