And</span> Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.

And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

Then his father and his mother said unto him, <i>Is there</i> never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/3a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Marriage, Interfaith.">wife</a> of the <sup>b</sup><a href="judg/14/3b" mark="b" type="A" title="Gen. 34: 14.">uncircumcised</a> Philistines?  And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

But his father and his mother knew not that it <i>was</i> of the <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/4a" mark="a" type="A" title="Josh. 11: 20."><span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span></a>, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had <sup>b</sup><a href="judg/14/4b" mark="b" type="A" title="Judg. 15: 11.">dominion</a> over Israel.

&#182; Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.

And the <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/6a" mark="a" type="A" title="1 Ne. 7: 17 (17-18).">Spirit</a> of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and <i>he had</i> nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.

&#182; And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, <i>there was</i> a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

&#182; So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/10a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 29: 22.">feast</a>; for so used the young men to do.

&#182; And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find <i>it</i> out, then I will give you thirty <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/12a" mark="a" type="P" title="HEB linen garments or tunics (also v. 13).">sheets</a> and thirty change of garments:

But if ye cannot declare <i>it</i> me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.  And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/15a" mark="a" type="A" title="Judg. 16: 5.">Entice</a> thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we <sup>b</sup><a href="judg/14/15b" mark="b" type="A" title="Judg. 15: 6.">burn</a> thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have?  <i>is it</i> not <i>so?</i>

And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/16a" mark="a" type="A" title="Judg. 16: 15.">riddle</a> unto the children of my people, and hast not told <i>it</i> me.

And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/14/17a" mark="a" type="D" title="IE pressed him hard.">lay</a> sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What <i>is</i> sweeter than honey?  and what <i>is</i> stronger than a lion?  And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

&#182; And the Spirit of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle.  And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.
