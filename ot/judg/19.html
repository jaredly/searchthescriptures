And</span> it came to pass in those days, when <i>there was</i> no king in Israel, that there was a certain <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/19/1a" mark="a" type="A" title="Judg. 17: 9.">Levite</a> sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.

And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, <i>and</i> to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

&#182; And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son in law, <sup>a</sup><a href="judg/19/5a" mark="a" type="D" title="OR Sustain (also v. 8).">Comfort</a> thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
