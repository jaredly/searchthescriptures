And Judah saw there a <sup>a</sup><a href="gen/38/2a" mark="a" type="B" title="TG Marriage, Interfaith.">daughter</a> of a certain Canaanite, whose name <i>was</i> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

And <sup>a</sup><a href="gen/38/7a" mark="a" type="A" title="Gen. 46: 12.">Er</a>, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span>; and the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> slew him.

And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <i>did.</i>  And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <i>is</i> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <i>this</i> breach <i>be</i> upon thee: therefore his name was called <sup>a</sup><a href="gen/38/29a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ruth 4: 18 (18-22); Luke 3: 33 (23-38).">Pharez</a>.
