But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this <i>matter.</i>

Be it known unto the <sup>a</sup><a href="ezra/5/8a" mark="a" type="A" title="D&C 123: 6.">king</a>, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.

But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon <i>the same</i> king <sup>a</sup><a href="ezra/5/13a" mark="a" type="A" title="Ezra 6: 14.">Cyrus</a> made a decree to build this house of God.

And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that <i>was</i> in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto <i>one,</i> whose name <i>was</i> Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;

Then came the same Sheshbazzar, <i>and</i> laid the foundation of the house of God which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and <i>yet</i> it is not finished.

Now therefore, if <i>it seem</i> good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which <i>is</i> there at Babylon, whether it be <i>so,</i> that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
