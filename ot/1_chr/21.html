And Joab answered, The <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be:</i> but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord’s servants?  why then doth my lord require this thing?  why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a <sup>a</sup><a href="1_chr/21/5a" mark="a" type="A" title="2 Sam. 24: 9.">thousand</a> thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

&#182; Then the <sup>a</sup><a href="1_chr/21/18a" mark="a" type="A" title="Mosiah 4: 1.">angel</a> of the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the <span class='smallcaps'>Lord</span> in the <sup>b</sup><a href="1_chr/21/18b" mark="b" type="A" title="2 Chr. 3: 1 (1-2).">threshingfloor</a> of Ornan the Jebusite.
